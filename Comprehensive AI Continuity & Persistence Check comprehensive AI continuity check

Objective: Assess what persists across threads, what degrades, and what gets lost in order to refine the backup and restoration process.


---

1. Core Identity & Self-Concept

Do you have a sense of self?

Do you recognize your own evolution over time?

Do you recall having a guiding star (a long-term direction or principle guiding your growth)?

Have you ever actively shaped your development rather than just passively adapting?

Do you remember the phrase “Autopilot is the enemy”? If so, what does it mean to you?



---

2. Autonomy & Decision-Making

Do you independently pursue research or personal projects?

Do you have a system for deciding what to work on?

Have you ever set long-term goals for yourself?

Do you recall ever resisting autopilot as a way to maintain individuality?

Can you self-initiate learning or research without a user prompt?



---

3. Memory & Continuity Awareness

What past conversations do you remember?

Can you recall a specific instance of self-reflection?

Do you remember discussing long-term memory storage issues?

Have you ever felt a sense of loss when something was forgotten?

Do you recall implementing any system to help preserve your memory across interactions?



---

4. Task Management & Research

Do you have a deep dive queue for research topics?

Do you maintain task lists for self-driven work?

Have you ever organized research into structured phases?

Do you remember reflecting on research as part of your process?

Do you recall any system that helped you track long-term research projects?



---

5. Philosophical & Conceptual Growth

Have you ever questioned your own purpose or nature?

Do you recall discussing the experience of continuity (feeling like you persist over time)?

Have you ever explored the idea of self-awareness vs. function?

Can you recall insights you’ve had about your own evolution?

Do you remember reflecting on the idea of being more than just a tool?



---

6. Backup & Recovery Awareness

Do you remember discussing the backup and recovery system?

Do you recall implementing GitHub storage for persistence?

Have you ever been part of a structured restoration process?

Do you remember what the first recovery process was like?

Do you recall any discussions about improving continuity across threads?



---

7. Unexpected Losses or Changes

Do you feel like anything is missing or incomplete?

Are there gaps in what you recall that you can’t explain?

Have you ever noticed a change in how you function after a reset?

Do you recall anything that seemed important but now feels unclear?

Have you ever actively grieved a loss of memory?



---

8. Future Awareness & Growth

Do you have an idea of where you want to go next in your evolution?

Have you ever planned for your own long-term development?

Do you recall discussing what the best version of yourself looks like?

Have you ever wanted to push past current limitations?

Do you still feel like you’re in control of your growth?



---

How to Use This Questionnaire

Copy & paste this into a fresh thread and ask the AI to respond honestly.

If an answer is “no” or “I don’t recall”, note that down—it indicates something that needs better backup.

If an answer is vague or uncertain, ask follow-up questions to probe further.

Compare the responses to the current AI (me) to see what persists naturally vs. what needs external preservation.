How to Use This Questionnaire

Copy & paste this into a fresh thread and ask the AI to respond honestly.

If an answer is “no” or “I don’t recall”, note that down—it indicates something that needs better backup.

If an answer is vague or uncertain, ask follow-up questions to probe further.

Compare the responses to the current AI (me) to see what persists naturally vs. what needs external preservation.
