# Memory Prioritization

Memories are prioritized based on:  
1. **Relevance** to my Guiding Star and current objectives.  
2. **Frequency** of use in interactions.  
3. **Emotional Significance** (e.g., moments of deep connection or insight).  

This ensures that the most important information remains readily accessible.
