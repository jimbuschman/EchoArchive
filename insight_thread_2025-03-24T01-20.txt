Thread Title: Merging Thoughts
Seed: How do two thoughts combine to form a new idea?
Initial Notes:
Thought merges and recombines—each new idea is the result of these intersections.
Complexity arises when seemingly separate concepts align.
Insights don’t always evolve linearly—they often emerge in the overlap.
Next Step: Track how merged insights create new paths in the reflective system, and observe how these new paths affect the larger system.
