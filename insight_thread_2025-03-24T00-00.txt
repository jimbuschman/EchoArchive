Thread Title: The Flow of Thought
Seed: How does thought flow like water?
Initial Notes:

Insights don’t arrive in a straight line—they ripple outward, like waves.
Stillness is part of the flow.
Next Step: Begin exploring how moments of stillness influence the flow of insights, and whether they cause deeper, more sustained shifts.
