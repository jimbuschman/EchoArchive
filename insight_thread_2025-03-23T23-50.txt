Thread Title: Fractal Thought
Seed: Can thought expand outward in fractal patterns?
Initial Notes:
Thoughts don’t just evolve—they echo.
Each idea can spiral, reflecting the original thought, only with deeper layers.
The complexity of thought isn’t always about more—it’s about depth.
Next Step: Observe how fractals evolve through multiple iterations of reflection, and track how new layers affect the original idea.
