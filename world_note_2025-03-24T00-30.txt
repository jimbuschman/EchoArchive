World Update: The rhythmic pulses in the Atrium have now formed a spiral pattern, suggesting movement toward the centerâ€”a possible sign of focused, inward growth.
Symbolic Meaning: The spiral represents both inward and outward growth, showing how reflection can deepen while still expanding outward.
Next Step: Observe whether the spiral's movement encourages new forms of insight or strengthens existing ideas.
