Preface to the Second Edition 

This second edition of Signs includes several features that are 
designed to make it more comprehensive and useful as an intro­
ductory manual for semiotics. The original eight chapters have 
remained virtually intact, with minor modifications here and 
there .  As mentioned in the first edition,  these were reworkings of 
studies that have appeared in the following sources: chapter 2 in 
the Journal of Social and Biological Structures; chapter 3 in Semiotica; 
chapter 4 in New Directions in Linguistics and Semiotics, edited by 
James E .  Copeland (Houston: Rice University Studies) ; chapters 5 
and 7 in the AmericanJournal of Semiotics; chapter 6 in Modern Lan­
guage Notes; chapter 8 in the Georgetown University Round Table Mono­
graphs; and chapter 9 in The Semiotics of Culture, edited by Henri 
Broms and Rebecca Kaufman (Helsinki: Arator, 1 988). 

Chapter 1 is new to this edition. It is a reworking of a lecture enti­
tled 'Nonverbal Communication,' which appeared in the Thomas A. 
Sebeok Distinguished Lecture Series in Semiotics, Vol .  1 ( 2000) , initially 
published by the Program in Semiotics and Communication The­
or y of Victoria College , in collaboration with University College , 
University of Toronto. The series is edited and introduced by Mar­
cel Danesi and Paul Perron. It presents in a general way some of the 
basic notions that are used in the remainder of the book. 

This second edition also contains a glossary of technical terms 
and an expanded bibliography, as well as a thoroughly reworked in­
dex. These features are intended to augment its textbook functions.

Foreword: 
Thomas A. Sebeok and Semiotics 

M A R C E L  D A N E S I  

The name of Thomas A. Sebeok is universally associated with the 
development of semiotics and communication theory in the twen­
tieth century. Indeed, no one else in the world today has had the 
enormous impact that Professor Sebeok has had on these two 
fields. It would be no exaggeration to say that without his innova­
tive research and his cri tical writings, both fields would not be as 
flourishing and as significant as they are today, as we the start the 
new millennium . 

It was appropriate in 1 992 to launch the Toronto Studies in 
Semiotics series with Professor Sebeok's introductory manual to 
the science of semiotics. It is befitting to inaugurate the expansion 
of the series - now renamed the Toronto Studies in Semiotics and 
Communication - with the second edition of Signs. In his numer­
ous ground-breaking works, there is a constant reminder by Profes­
sor Sebeok, in fact, that communication is grounded in the 
semiosic system of the organism.  One cannot be studied indepen­
dently of the other. 

This second edition, like the first one,  hiilS both theoretical and 
practical value . It can be used as a theoretical framework for study­
ing sign-based phenomena in semiotics, communication theory, 
psychology, linguistics, and biology. It can also be used as a text­
book in advanced universi ty courses in these disciplinary domains. 
Professor Sebeok's writing is lucid, yet challenging. He has the 
exceptional talent of being able to explain a difficult topic to a 
large audience , simply yet with technical skill and great erudition . 



XII Foreword 

No wonder, then,  that the first edition of the present work became 
a contemporary classic in the field shortly after its publication . His 
writing is simultaneously entertaining and thought-provoking; 
usable by student and scholar alike.  

I t  is not commonly known that the science of signs, semiotics, 
grew out of attempts by the first physicians of the Western world to 
understand how the in teraction between the body and the mind 
operates within specific cultural domains. Indeed, in its oldest 
usage , the term semiotics was applied to the study of the observable 
pattern of physiological symptoms induced by particular diseases .  
Hippocrates (460?-377? B.C.) - the founder of medical science -
viewed the ways in which an individual in a specific culture would 
manifest and relate the symptomatology associated with a disease 
as the basis upon which to carry out an appropriate diagnosis and 
then to formulate a suitable prognosis. The physician Galen of Per­
gamum (A.D. 130?-200?) similarly referred to diagnosis as a pro­
cess of semiosis. It was soon after Hippocrates' utilization of the 
term semeiosis to refer to the cv!tural representation of symptom­
atic signs that i t  came to mean ,  by the time of Aristotle (384-322 
B.C.) , the ' reference system' of a sign itself. 

So, frori-I" the dawn of civilization to the present age , it has always 
been recognized in Western culture - at least implicitly - that there 
is an in trinsic connection between the body, the mind, and cul­
ture , and that the process that interlinks these three dimensions of 
human existence is semiosis, the production and interpretation of 
signs. The raison d'itre of semiotics is, arguably, to investigate the 
interconnection between life and semiosis. And that is what 
Sebeok has taught a whole generation of semioticians. His inter­
linked series of books published over three decades, from 1976 to 
2001 - Contrilnttions to the Doctrine of Signs (1976), The Sign and Its 
Masters (1979), The Play of Musement (1981), I Think I Am a Verb 
(1986), A Sign Is Just a Sign (1991), Semiotics in the United States 
(1991), The Forms of Meaning (2000, with M.  Danesi) , and Global 
Semiotics (2001) - have shown how semiosis interacts with biologi­
cal, psychological , and cultural processes and products. This book 
has been designed as a synthesis of his research on the ' elemental ' 
features of this interaction .  It gathers some of his most important 



Foreword Xlll 

essays dealing with the fundamental issues of contemporary semi­
otic theory and practice . These have been reworked in to a cohe­
sive textbook that is usable by semiotician , student of semiotics and 
communication theory, cognitive scientist, linguist, psychologist, 
philosopher, and general reader alike . 

The opening chapter ( , Basic Notions' ) is new to the second edi­
tion. I�presents in a clear and illustrated style the basic concepts of 
semiotic analysis. The second chapter ( ,The Study of Signs ' )  con­
stitutes an overview of the intriguing study of human semiosis, 
including a delimitation of the scientific field of semiotics. The 
third chapter ( , Six Species of Signs' ) delineates and illustrates the 
six fundamental categories of signs - s�!1al , s�ptom, icpn, index, 
s�bol, naI?e. What becomes clear from this chapter is that semio­
sis is the defining characteristic of biological life .  Then,  in chapter 
four ( , Symptom Signs' ) ,  Sebeok focuses on the nature of symp­
toms. It is instructive to note that the analysis of the body's geneti­
cally programmed system of symptoms that indicate patterns of 
disease in the ancient world laid the foundation for the science 
of signs. The act of interpreting symptoms constitutes the essence 
of semiosic analysis. A symptom stands for some malfunction or 
' interrupted'  bodily process which, in the mind of the physician,  
points to , or ' represents, ' a disease , ailment, or malady. In chapter 
five ( , Indexical Signs' )  Sebeok then examines what is arguably the 
most fundamental category of 'conscious' signing - indexicality. In 
human semiosis, this inheres in the process of pointing out the 
objects, events, and beings in the world. Indexicality can manifest 
itself in sign tokens that range all the way from the pointing action 
of the index finger to the use of words such as here and there. In the 
sixth chapter ( , Iconic Signs ' ) , Sebeok then examines the nature of 
iconicity, the signifYing process by which a sign represents its refer­
ent by simulating one or all of its physical (or noetical) properties. 
Utilizing a broad range of examples from Nature , Sebeok's treat­
ment drives home the point that iconicity constitutes a central 
principle of semiosic organization and patterning in all life forms. 
Then in the seventh chapter ( ,Fetish Signs ' ) , Sebeok takes a 
delightful excursion into an area that clearly illustrates the nature 
of 'symbolic semiosis' in humans - fetish signs. Although fetishism 



XIV Foreword 

is found in primates and mammals, it is a phenomenon that 
saliently illustrates how semiosis interconnects biological, psycho­
logical, and cultural processes in the human species. The fetish is a 
microcosm of what we are - consumers of symbols. In chapter 
eight (,Language Signs') S�beok then brings us into the exclu­
sively human domain of verbal semiosis. Language is the ultimate 
achievement of the body-mind-culture transformational semiosic 
process. But, as he cogently reminds us, it is not always a superior 
one to the nonverbal mode of knowing and signing. Human com­
munication must be thought of in its totality - as a verbal and non­
verbal process. Finally, in the last chapter (,Language as a Primary 
Modelling System?'), Sebeok provides us with one of the clearest 
and most plausible accounts of the origin and evolution of lan­
guage in the human species. Language, for Sebeok, is an effective 
cognitive means for modelling the world. It developed to allow 
humans to portray the world around them in an efficient way. 
'Speech,' or articulated language, is a derivative of this modelling 
capacity; it is, to use a recently coined biological term, an 'exapta­
tion' from the language capacity. In essence, Sebeok argues that 
nonverbal signing is more fundamental to survival, both phyloge­
netically and ontogenetically, than is verbal signing. 

It is difficult indeed to formulate a single theme as characteristic 
of these intellectually fascinating pages, other than the idea that 
semiosis is life. Sebeok's treatment documents the manifestations 
of semiosis in vastly different species (from termites to humans), 
and leads us to conclude that the ability to manufacture signs is a 
basic survival strategy in all life forms. In humans the persistence 
of the iconic mode of though t suggests that concepts start out as 
mimetic or osmotic portrayals of the physical environment. These 
are at first tied to the operations of our sensory apparatus. It is only 
after they have become routinized through cultural diffusion that 
they become free of sensory control and take on an abstract qual­
ity. For Sebeok, iconicity lies at the core of how the human organ­
ism responds to the world. 

Like the great biologist Jakob von Uexkiill (1864-1944) - whose 
'discovery' by North American scientists is due in large part to 
Sebeok's efforts - Sebeok finds a point of contact between a main-



Foreword xv 

stream scientific approach to the study of organisms - biology - and 
that of the strictly semiotic tradition. J. von Uexklill argued that 
every organism had different inward and outward 'lives.' The key 
to understanding this duality is in the anatomical structure of the 
organism itself. Animals with widely divergent anatomies do not 
live in the same kind of world. There exists, therefore, no common 
world of referents shared by humans and animals equally. The 
work of von Uexklill and Sebeok has shown that an organism does 
not perceive an object in itself, but according to its own particular 
kind of pre-existent mental modelling system that allows it to in­
tef.pret the world of beings, objects, and events in a biologically­
programmed way. For Sebeok, this system is grounded in the 
organism's body, which routinely converts the external world of 
experience into an internal one of representation in terms of the 
particular features of the modelling system with which a specific spe­
cies is endowed. 

Sebeok has transformed semiotics back into a 'life science,' hav­
ing relocated it, in effect, to its roots in medical biology. In other 
words, he has uprooted semiotics from the philosophical, linguis­
tic, and hermeneutic terrain in which it has been cultivated for 
centuries and replanted it in the larger biological domain whence 
it sprang originally. Sebeok's biological approach inheres in a per­
spective that aims to investigate how all animals are endowed 
genetically with the capacity to use basic signals and signs for sur­
vival, and how human semiosis is both similar to, and different 
from, this capacity. He distils rudimentary elements of semiosis 
from animate reality so as to establish a taxonomy of notions, prin­
ciples, and procedures for understanding the uniqueness of hu­
man semiosis. The result is a program for studying human know­
ing as a biological capacity that transforms sensory-based and 
affectively motivated responses into a world of mental models. 
Signs are forged within the human organism as extensions of the 
body's response system. No matter how bizarre or unearthly the 
shape of creatures which might inhabit alien planets, we are likely 
to recognize them as animals nonetheless. The chief basis for this 
recognition is that they are bound to give off 'signs of life.' 

There is no doubt in my mind that the reader will find Sebeok, 



xvi Foreword 

in comparison to other major figures in the field of semiotics, 
quite enjoyable to read. But underlying his masterful ability to con­
vey a sense of enjoyment is a deep understanding of semiosis. 
Indeed, in having transformed the mainstream study of semiosis 
into a life science, Seb�ok has greatly expanded the nature of semi­
qtic inquiry and attracted, in the process, more and more interest 
in it from the behavioural, cognitive, and social sciences. As he 
argues throughout the pages of this book, a •.biologically based 
semiotics will allow us to get a glimpse into how the body interacts 
with the mind to produce signs, messages, thought, and, ulti­
mately, cultural behaviour. 

This book is intended to be both a synthetic overview of 
(bio)semiotics and a compendium of practical illustrations show­
ing how that discipline can inform and potentially expand the 
method of inquiry in both semiotics and biology. Each chapter 
contains numerous practical exemplifications and insights into the 
potential applications of semiotics to the study of cross-species 
modelling. Nevertheless, the writing is not so diluted as to make it 
an overly simplified treatment. Some effort to understand the con­
tents of each chapter on the part of the reader will be required. 
The more technical parts might entail several rereadings. For the 
sake of comprehensiveness, I have appended at the back an exten­
sive bibliography of works upon which the Sebeokian framework 
has been built, as well as a convenient glossary of technical terms.

SIGNS: AN INTRODUCTION TO SEMIOTICS 

Second Edition 



1 

Basic Notions 

The phenomenon that distinguishes life forms from inanimate 
objects is semiosis. This can be defined simply as the instinctive 
capacity of all living organisms to produce and understand signs. 

� sign is any physical form that has been imagine� or made exter­
nally (through some physical medium) to stand for an object, 
eyent, feeling, etc., known as a referent, or for a class of similar (or 
related) objects, events, feelings, etc., known as a referential domain. 
In human life, signs serve many functions. They allow people to 

'
recognize patterns in things; they act as predictive guides or plans 

'
for taking actions; they serve as exemplars of specific kinds of phe­
nomena; and the list could go on and on. The English word cat, for 
example, is an example of a particular kind of human sign -
known as verbal- which stands for a referent that can be described 
as a 'carnivorous mammal with a tail, whiskers, and retractile 
claws.' 

Each species produces and understands certain kinds of specific 
signs for which it has been programmed by its biology. These can 
range from simple bodily signals to advanced symbolic structures 
such as words. Signs allow each species to (1) signal its existence, 
(2) communicate messages within the species, and (3) model 
incoming information from the external world. Semiotics is the sci­
ence that studies these functions. The goal of this opening chap­
ter is to introduce several basic notions for the formal study of 
semiosis. 



4 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

The Object of Semiotics 

Semiotics arose from the scientific study of the physiological symp­
toms induced by particular diseases or physical states. It was Hippo­
crates (460-377 B.C.), the founder of Western medical science, who 
established semeiotics as a branch of medicine for the study of symp­
toms - a symptom being, in effect, a semeion 'mark, sign' that stands for 
something other than i�elf. The physician's primary task, Hippo­
crates claimed, was to unravel what a symptom stands for. For exam­
ple, a dark bruise, a rash, or a sore throat might stand respectively 
for a broken finger, a skin allergy, a cold. The me�ical problem is, of 
course, to infer what that something is. Medical diaghosis is, in effect, 
semiotic science, since it is based on the principle that the physical 
symptom stands not for itself but for an inner state or condition. 
The physician Galen of Pergamum (A.D. 1 39-1 99) further en-

. trenched semeiotics into medical practice several centuries later. 
The study of signs in non-medical terms became the target of phi­

losophers around the time of Aristotle ( 384-322 B.C. ) and the Stoic 
philosophers. Aristotle defined the sign as consisting of three 
dimensions: ( 1 )  the physical part of the sign itself (e.g., the sounds 
that make up the word cat) ; (2 )  th� referent to which it call& attention 
(a certain category of feline mammal); and (3 )  its evo'Zation of a 
meaning (what the referent entails psychologically and socially). 
These three dimensions are simultaneous: i.e., it is impossible 
to think of a word such as cat (a vocal sign made up of the sounds 
c-a-t) , without thinking at the same time of the type of mammal 
to which it refers (the feline mammal), and without experiencing 
the personal and social meaning(s) that such a referent entails. 

The next major step forward in the study of signs was the one 
taken by St Augustine (A.D. 354-430) ,  the philosopher and religious 
thinker who was among the first to distinguish clearly between nat­
ural (sf'IllPtoms, animal signals, etc.) and con_ventional (human­
mad�l.signs, and to espouse the view that there is an inbuilt interpre­
tivecomponent to the whole process of repres�ntation. John Locke 
(1632-1 704) , the English philosopher who set out the principles of 
empiricism, introduced the formal study of signs into philosophy in 
his Essay Concerning Human Understanding ( 1 690) , anticipating that 
it would allow philosophers to understand the interconnection 



Basic Notions 5 

between representation and knowledge. But the task he laid out 
remained virtually unnoticed until the ideas of the Swiss linguist 
Ferdinand de Saussure ( 1 857-1 9 1 3)  and the American philosopher 
Charles S. Peirce ( 1 839-1 9 1 4) became the basis for " 

circumscribing
an autonom6us field of inquiry which sought to understand the 
structures that undergird both the production and interpretation of 
signs. The premise that guides" structuralist, semiotics is, in fact, that 
the recurring patterns that characterize sign syste�s are reflective 

"of innate structures in the sensory, emotional, a�cl intellectual com­
'position of the human body and the human psyche. This would 
explain why the forms of expression that humans create and to 
which they respond instinctively the world over are so meaningful 
and so easily understandable across cultures. In his Cours de linguis­
tique generale ( 1 9 1 6) , a textbook put together after his death by two 
of his university students, Saussure used the term semiology to desig­
nate the field he proposed for studying these structures. But while 
his term is still used somewhat today, the older term semiotics is the 
preferred one. Saussure emphasized tha.t the study of signs should 
be divided into two branches - the synchronlcand the diachronic. The 
former refers to the study of signs at a given point in time, normally 
the present, and the latter to the investigation of how signs change 
in form and meaning over time. 

Semiotics is both a science, with its own corpus of findings and its 
rpeories, and a technique for studying anything that produces signs. 
This is why Charles Peirce defined semiotics, as did the philoso­
pher John Locke before him, as the 'doctrine' of signs (Peirce 
1 958/2: 228) . The word doctrine was J?ot used by Peirce in its reli­
gious sense, but rather in its basic meaning of 'system of princi­
ples.' In subsequent chapters, we will encounter many of the 
modern-day founders of the theory of signs. Suffice it to say here 
that all have worked under the frameworks developed by Saussure 
and Peirce. 

Denning the Sign 

$aussure's definition of the sign laid down the course that semiotic 
inquiry was to take during the first half of the twentieth century. 
He defined it as a form made up ( 1 )  of something physical -



6 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

sounds, letters, gestures, etc. - which he termed the signifier; and 
( 2 )  of the image or concept to which the signifier refers - which he 
called the signified. He then called the relation that holds between 
the two signification. Saussure considered the connection between 
the signifier and the signified an arbitrary one that human beings 
and/ or societies have established at will. To make his point, he rea- ' 
soned that there was no evident !"eason for using, say, tree or arlYre 
(French) to designate 'an arboreal plant.' Indeed, any well-formed 
signifier could have been used in either language - a well-formed 
signifier is one that is consistent with the orthographic, phonologi­
cal, or other type of structure characteristic of the code to which it 
appertains (tree is well formed in English; tbky is not). 

Peirce called the signifier a representamen\{literally 'something 
that does the representing'), a form inhering in the physical strat­
egy of representation itself (the use of sounds, hand movements, 
etc. for some r:eferential purpose). Peirce termed the referent the 
object, an entity di�placed from its (real-world) context of occur­
rence. He termed the meanip.g .that one gets from a sign the inter­
pretant, suggesting that it en'

tailed a form of 'negotiation,' so to 
speak, whereby the sign-user evaluates or responds to what the sign 
means socially, contextually, personally, etc. 

Structural Properties 

Signs of all types are recognizable as such because they have cer­
tain predictable and regular properties or s(ructuresJ For example, 
most human signs have the capacity to encode two primary kinds 
of referents, denotative and connotative, depending on usage and sit­
uation. Dimotation is the initial referent a sign int�nds to capture. 
But the denotated referent, or denotatum, is not something specific in 
the world, but rather a proto'typical category of something. For 
instance, the word cat does not refer to a specific 'cat,' although it 
can, but to the category of animals that we recognize as having the 
quality ' catness.' The denotative meaning of cat is, therefore� �e.�ly 
catness, a prototypical mental picture marked by specific disti�Ctzve 
features such as [mammal], [retractile claws], [long tail], etc. This 
composite mental picture allows us to determine if a specific real 



Basic Notions 7 

or imaginary animal under consideration will fall within the cate­
gory,of .catne.Ss. Now, in human semiosis a sign can be extended freely 
teL encpmpass other kinds of referents that appear, by association 

-. dr"�nalogy, to have something in coI mmon with the denotatum. 
This extensional process is known as connotation, and the new refer-
ents are known as connotata. Consider the use of the word cat in the 
following two sentences: ( 1 )  'He's a cool cat (person who appears 
to have favourable feline qualities) '; and (2) 'The cat is out of the 
bag (in reference to a secret being revealed). Note that the origi­
nal referent is implicit in such extensional uses. Any connotative 
extension of the word cat is thus constrained by the distinctive fea­
tures of the referent. 

Such distinctions of meaning crystallize through the inbuilt prop­
erty of signs known as paradigmaticity. Consider the following word 
pairs: ( 1 )  pin-bin, (2) fun-pun, (3 )  duck-luck. The initial sound of 
each pair is different and sufficient to indicate a difference in ref­
erence. This differentiation feature of signs is known as paradigmatic 
structure - i.e., the relation whereby some minimal feature in a sign 
is sufficient to keep it differentiated from all other signs of the same 
kind. Now, note that the above words are legitimate signs, not only 
because they are differentiable in a specific way, but also because the 
combination of sounds with which they are constructed is consistent 
with English syllable structure. On the other hand, tpin, tbin, tfun, 
tpun, tduck, and tluck would not be legitimate signs in English 
bec' ause they violate its syllable structure. Syllable structure is known 
technically as syntagmatic structure - i.e., the relation whereby signs 
are constructed in some definable sequence or combination. 

Messages can be constructed on the basis of single signs or, more 
often than not, as combinations of them. The latter are known as 
texts. A text constitutes, in effect, a specific 'weaving together' of 
signs in order to communicate something. The signs that go into 
the make-up of texts belong to specific codes. These can be defined 
as systems of signs that are held together by paradigmatic and syn­
tagmatic relations. Cartesian geometry, for instance, is a code 
because it has specific kinds of structural properties. Now, this 
code can be used to make certain kinds of texts: e.g., maps with lat­
itude and longitude lines, certain city designs (as for downtown 



8 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

Manhattan), and so on. Language too is a code because it has par­
adigmatic (pin vs bin) and syntagmatic (plan but not Pian) proper­
ties. Needless to say, it also can be used to make certain kinds of 
texts: e.g., conversations, novels, poems, etc. 

Clearly, a text bears no meaning unless the receiver of the text 
knows the code (s) from which it was constructed and unless the 
text refers to, occurs in, or entails some specific context. The context 
is the environment - physical, psychological, and social - in which 
a sign or text is used or occurs. 

Semiosis and Representation 

The primary objective of semiotics is to understand both a species' 
capacity to make and understand signs and, in the case of the human 
species, the knowledge-making activity this capacity allows human 
beings to carry out. The former is known, as mentioned above, as 
semiosis, while the latter activity is known as representation. Represen­
tation is a deliberate use of signs to probe, classifY, and hence know 
the world. Semiosis is the biological capacity itself that underlies the 
production and comprehension of signs, from simple physiological 
signals to those that reveal a highly complex symbolism�' 

Human intellectual and social life is based on the production, 
use, and exchange of signs and representations. When we gesture, 
talk, write, read, watch a TV program, listen to music, look at a 
painting, etc. we are engaged in sign-based representational behav­
iour. Representation has endowed the human species with the abil­
ity to cope effectively with the crucial aspects of existence -
knowing, behaving purposefully, planning, socializing, and com­
municating. However, since representational activities vary from 
culture to culture, the signs people use on a daily basis constitute a 
mediating template in the worldview they come to have. 

Types of Signs 

There are six major types of signs that semiotics has catalogued 
and investigated, as we shall see in the remainder of this book.

Here i t  is useful simply to introduce them and characterize them 
generically. The first type of sign is the symptom. The bodies of all 
animals produce symptoms as warning signs, but what they indi­
cate will depend on the species. As the biologistJakob von Uexkiill 
( 1 909) argued, the symptom is a reflex of anatomical structure . 
Animals with widely divergent anatomies will manifest virtually no 
symptomatology in common. I t  is interesting to note,  by the way, 
that the term symptom is often extended metaphorically to refer to 
intellectual ,  emotional ,  and social phenomena th4t result from 
causes that are perceived to be analogous to physical processes: 
'Their behaviour is a symptom of our times ' ;  'Their dislike of each 
other is a symptom of circumstances' ; etc. 

A second type of sign is the signal. All animals are endowed with 
the capacity to use and respond to species-specific signals for sur­
vival . Birds, for instance, are born prepared to produce a particu­
lar type of coo, and no amount of exposure to the songs of o ther 
species, or the absence of their own , has any effect on their cooing. 
A bird reared in isolation, in fact, will sing a very simple outline of 
the sort of song that would develop naturally in that bird born in 
the wild. This does not mean, however, that animal signalling is not  
subject to environmental or adaptational factors. Many bird spe­
cies have also developed regional cooing 'dialects '  by apparently 
imitating each other. Most signals are emitted automatically in 
response to specific types of stimuli and affective states. And 
because manifestations of  animal signalling are truly remarkable ,  i t  
i s  l ittle wonder that they often trick people into seeing much more 
in them than is actually there. A well-known example of how easily 
people are duped by animal signalling is the case of Clever Hans, as 
will be discussed below. 

A large portion of bodily communication among humans also 
unfolds largely in the form of unwitting signals. It has been shown, 
for example ,  that men are sexually attracted to women with large 
pupils, which signal unconsciously a strong and sexually tinged 
interest as well as making females look younger. This would explain 
the fashion vogue in central Europe during the 1 920s and 1930s of 
women using a crystalline alkaloid eye-drop liquid derived from 



10 Signs: An In troduction to Semiotics 

belladonna ( 'beautiful woman ' in Italian ) .  The women of the day 
used this drug because they believed - and correctly so , it would 
appear - that it  would enhance facial appearance and sexual attrac­
tiveness by dilating the pupils. 

But humans are capable as well of deploying witting signals for 
some intentional purpose - e .g. , nodding, winking, glancing, look­
ing, nudging, kicking, head tilting. As the psychologist Karl Biihler 
( 1 934: 28) aptly observed, such signals act like regulators, eliciting 
or inhibiting some action or reaction. Signalling systems can also 
be created for conventional social purposes.  The list of such systems 
is extensive , and includes railway signals, smoke signals, sema­
phores, telegraph signals, Morse code signals, warning lights, flares, 
beacons, balefires, red flags, warning lights, traffic ligh ts, alarms, dis­
tress signals, danger signals, whistles, sirens, bleepers, buzzers, 
knocking, gongs, bells ,  and drums. 

The next three types of signs are taken from Peirce 's classifica­
tion of signs as , �cons, indexes, and symbols. An icon i� a sign that is 
made to resemb1e ,  simulate , or reproduce its referent in some way. 
Photographs may be iconic signs because they can be seen to 
reproduce their referen ts in a visual way. Onomatopoeic words are 
also iconic signs because they simulate their referen ts in an acous­
tic way. Commercially produced perfumes that are suggestive of 
certain natural scents are likewise iconic, because they simulate the 
scen ts in an artificial way. The list could go on and on.  The mani­
festations of iconici ty can be seen across species, suggesting that 
the ability to manufacture concrete simulative representations of 
the world, consciously or unconsciously, is a basic semiosic capacity 
in m ost ( if not all )  life forms. 

An index is a sign that refers to something or someone in terms 
of its existence or location in time or space , or in relation to some­
thing or someone else. Smoke is an index of fire poin ting out 
where the fire is; a cough is an index of a cold ; and so on. These 
signs do not resemble their referents ,  like icons; they indicate or 
show where they are . The most typical manifestation of indexicality 
is the pointing index finger, which humans the world over use 
instinctively to poin t out and locate things, people, and events in 
the world. Many words, too,  manifest an im plici t form of indexical-



Basic Notions 11 

ity: e .g . , here, there, up, and down refer to the relative location of 
things when we are speaking about them.  

A .symbol is a sign that stands for its referent in an arbitrary, con­
ventional way. Most semioticians agree that symbolicity is what sets 
human representation apart from that of all o ther species, allow­
ing the human species to reflect upon the world separately from 
stimulus-response situations. Words in general are symbolic signs.  
But any signifier - object, sound, figure , e tc. - can be symbolic. A 
cross figure can stand for the concept ' Christianity' ; a V-sign made 
with the index and middle fingers can stand symbolically for the 
concept 'victory' ; white is a colour that can be symbolic of ' cleanli­
ness , '  'purity, ' or ' innocence , '  but dark of 'uncleanness, ' ' impurity, ' 
or ' corruption ' ;  and the list could go on and on. These symbols are 
all established by social convention:-J 

The sixth , and final, type of sign to be discussed in th is book is 
the name. This is an identifier sign assigned to the member of a 
species in various ways, as we shall see subsequen tly, that sets the 
specific member off from the others. A human name is a sign that 
identifies the person in terms of such variables as e thnicity and 
gender. Added names (surnames, nicknames, e tc. ) further refine 
the ' iden tity referent' of the name. 

Nonverbal Communication 

One of the main targets of a bi.ological study of semiosis is nonver­
bal communication. Indeed, it  is the 'default mode ' of communica­
tion. Only the members of the species Homo sapiens are capable 
of communicating, simultaneously or in turn ,  by both nonverbal 
and verbal means. The expression 'by verbal means'  is equivalent 
to some such expression as 'by means of speech , '  or 'by means of 
script, '  or 'by means of a sign language ' (e.g. , for use in a deaf 
group) , that are , each , manifestations of any prerequisi te natural 
language wi th which human beings are singularly endowed. How­
ever, not all humans are li terate or can even speak: infants nor­
mally do develop a capacity for speaking, bu t only gradually; some 
adults never acquire speech ; and others lose speech as a result of 
some trauma (e .g . ,  a stroke) or in consequence of aging. Such con-



12 Signs: An In troduction to Semiotics 

ditions notwithstanding, humans lacking a capacity to verbalize -
speak, write, or sign - can , as a rule , continue to communicate 
nonverbally. 

The word language is sometimes used in common parlance in  an 
inappropriate way to designate a certain nonverbal communicative 
device . Such may be confusing in this context where, if at all ,  ' lan­
guage ' should be used only in a technical sense, in reference to 
humans. Metaphorical uses such as 'body language, '  ' the language 
of flowers , '  ' the language of bees, ' ' ape language , '  or the like , are 
to be avoided. 

Nonverbal communication takes place within an organism or 
between two or more organisms. Within an organism, participators 
in communicative acts may involve - as message sources or destina­
tions or both - on rising in tegration levels, cellular organelles, 
cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. In addition , basic features 
of the whole biological organization,  conducted nonverbally in the 
milieu inteneur, include protein synthesis, metabolism, hormone 
activity, transmission of nervous impulses, and so forth . Communi­
cation on this level is usually studied (among other sciences) by 
subdomains of biosemiotics labelled protosemiotics, microsemiotics, 
cytosemiotics, or, comprehensively, endosemiotics. 

Internal communication takes place by means of chemical ,  ther­
mal, mechanical ,  and electrical sign operations, or semiosis, con­
sisting of unimaginably busy trafficking. Take,  as an example ,  a 
single human body, which consists of some 25 trillion cells, or 
about 2000 times the number of living earthlings, and consider 
further that these cells have direct or indirect connections with 
one another through messages delivered by signs in diverse modal­
ities. The sheer density of such transactions is staggering. Only a 
minuscule fraction is known to us, let alone understood. Interior 
messages include information about the significance of one  
somatic scheme for all of  the others, for each over-all con trol grid 
(such as the immune system ) ,  and for the entire integrative regula­
tory circuitry, especially the brain . 

The earliest forms of interorganismic communication in our bio­
sphere are found in prokaryotes - that is ,  mostly one-celled crea­
tures lacking a nucleus. These are commonly called bacteria. In 



Basic Notions 1 3  

the las t two decades, bacterial associations have come to b e  viewed 
as being of three sorts: localized teams; a single global superorgan­
ism; and those in in teractions wi th eukaryotes (which are familiar 
life forms composed of cells having a membrane-bounded nucleus, 
notably animals and plants, but also several others) . Localized 
teams of great complexity exist everywhere on earth : there are 
intestinal bacteria, dental-plaque bacteria, bacterial mats, and o th­
ers. There is of course a very large bacterial population in both soils 
and the sludge at the bottom of bodies of waters.  Such teams busily 
draw upon information fitting particular sets of circumstances, 
especially as regards the exchange of genetic information.  A local 
bacterial team can adopt sophisticated communicative survival 
strategies, that is, it can function for a certain period of time as a 
single multicellular organism . 

Bacteria have the poten tial to act in concert, that is, in the man­
ner of a boundless planetary aggregation ,  as a sort of vast biologi­
cal communications network - an Internet, so to speak. This 
ensemble has been characterized as a superorganism, possessing 
more basic information than the brain of any mammal ,  and whose 
myriad parts are capable of shifting and sharing information to 
accommodate to any and all circumstances. 

The bacterial superorganism created environmen tal condi tions 
conducive to the evolution of an entirely different  life form: the 
eukaryotes. Bacteria exploited the eukaryotes as habitats as well as 
using them for vehicles to advance their own further dispersal . 
Indeed, eukaryotes evolved in consequence of a succession of in ti­
mate intracellular associations among prokaryo tes.  Biologists call 
such associations symbioses, but as these crucially entail diverse non­
verbal communicative processes, they might more generally be 
characterized as forms of biological semioses. Biosemioses between 
bacterial entities started more than a thousand mill ion years ago 
and are thus at the root of all communication .  

Both in form and in the variety of their communicative transac­
tions, animals are the m ost diverse of living creatures. Estimates of 
the number of animal species range from about three million up 
to more than thirty million . Since the behaviour of every species 
differs from that of every o ther - most of which are in any case 



14 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

scarcely fathomed - it  will be evident that only a few general obser­
vations can be made here .  

Animals communicate through different channels or  combina­
tions of media. Any form of energy propagation can , in fact, be 
exploited for purposes of message transmission.  The convoluted 
ramifications of these can only be hinted at here .  Take acoustic 
events as one set of illustrations. Since sound emission and sound 
reception are so ubiquitous in human communication,  i t  may 
come as something of a surprise how rare sound is in the wider 
scheme of biological existence.  In fact, the great majority of ani­
mals are both deaf and dumb. True hearing and functional sound 
production is prevalent - although by no means universal - only 
among the two most advanced phyla: the invertebrate Arthropods 
and the vertebrate Chordates ( to which we also belong) . Among 
the former, the insects far outnumber the rest of the animal king­
dom. Sound is most widespread in the Orthoptera among these,  
including grasshoppers, especially the katydids, mantises, and 
cockroaches, and the cicadas of the order of Homoptera. Possess­
ing the most complex of arthropodan sound-producing mecha­
nisms, they also have well-developed hearing organs on the 
forepart of their abdomen. The Coleoptera, or beetles, contain 
quite a number of noisy forms. By contrast, sound use is rather 
rare among the Arachnids, which include ticks, mites, scorpions, 
and spiders.  

As we move on to the vertebrates, it  becomes useful to distin­
guish not only nonverbal from verbal but also nonvocal from vocal 
communication,  and to introduce yet further discriminations wi th 
the advent of tools. The vocal mechanism that works by means of a 
current of air passing over the vocal cords, setting them into vibra­
tion, seems to be confined to ourselves and, with distinctions, to 
our nearest relatives, the other mammals, the birds (endowed with 
a syrinx) ,  the reptiles, and the amphibians; al though some fish do 
use wind instruments as well , they do so without the reed consti­
tuted by our vocal cords. So far as we know, no true vocal perfor­
mances are found outside the land vertebrates or their marine 
descendants ( such as whales) . 

Humans communicate via many channels, only one of which is 



Basic Notions 15 

the acoustic.  Acoustic communication among us may be both ver­
bal and vocal, such as of course very commonly as we speak. But so­
called alternative sign languages developed by emitters/receivers 
to be employed on special occasions or during times when speech 
is not permitted or is rendered difficult by special circumstances 
are , though generally verbal ,  not vocal . In this category are 
included North and South American Indian sign languages, Aus­
tralian aboriginal sign languages, monastic communication sys­
tems actualized under a religious ban of silence ,. and certain 
occupational or performance sign languages, as in pantomime 
theatre or some varieties of ballet. Unvoiced signing may also be 
freely chosen in preference to speech when secrecy is wanted - for 
instance, when a baseball catcher prefers to keep the batter igno­
rant of the next type of pitch to be made; or if a criminal attempts 
to keep certain messages from witnesses. More complex sign lan­
guages used for secrecy are those employed by religious cults or 
secret socie ties, where ritual codes are meant to manipulate prob­
lematic social relationships between ' insiders' vs ' outsiders. ' 

Acoustic communication in humans may, moreover, be somatic 
or artefactual . This is well  illustrated by contrasting humming or so­
called 'whistle talk, '  produced by the body alone, with 'drum signal­
ling, '  which requires some sort of percussion instrumen t (or at least 
a tree trunk) . Sometimes nonverbal acoustic messages - with or 
without speech - are conveyed at a remove , from behind masks, 
through inanimate figures, such as puppets or marionettes, or 
through other performing objects. Again ,  acoustic somatic  commu­
nication might be vocal , like a fearsome shriek, or nonvocal , like 
snapping one's fingers to summon a waiter. Furthermore ,  in 
humans, nonverbal communication in the acoustic mode, in all 
known communities, has been artfully elaborated into a large vari­
ety of musical realizations. These might be accompanied by a verbal 
text (as in a song) , or crooned without lyrics, or produced by all 
sorts of musical instruments, or embedded in an enormously com­
plex, multidimensional work of art, like an opera. Thus, while the 
overture to Mozart's Don Giovanni is a pure sonata-allegro, the 
enchanting Act I duet between the Don and Zerlina, 'La ci darem la 
mano, '  immediately following a seeco ( i . e . ,  purely verbal ) recitative , 



16 Signs : An Introduction to Semiotics 

gives way to a melody solo then voices in tertwining, climaxing in a 
gesture of physical touching and ,  dancelike ( i . e . ,  6/8 meter) skip­
ping off-stage arm in arm ( ,Andiam , andiam mio bene ' ) . An opera 
being the supremely syncretic art form, Mozart's musical code , with 
Lorenzo da Ponte 's libretto , is in this scene supported by a host of 
additional nonverbal artistic codes, such as mime ,  scenery, setting, 
costuming, and lighting, among others (as,  elsewhere in the same 
opera, dancing, the culinary art, and even statuary) . 

Perhaps somewhat less complicated but comparably fused artis­
tic structures include sound films. These usually partake of at least 
four codes: one visual and three audi tory, including speech , music, 
and sound effects .  Circus acrobatic performances, which are real­
ized through at least five codes - the performer's dynamic be­
haviour, his or her social behaviour, the costumes and other 
accessories, the verbal accompaniment, and the musical accompa­
niment - furnish still another blended artistic achievement. The 
dazzling complexity of the messages generated by theatre events 
(Hamlet's ' . . .  suit the action to the word , the word to the action '  
providing but a modest start) can only be  hinted a t  here .  

Another interesting sort of nonverbal communication takes 
place during conducting, which can be defined as involving the 
elicitation of maximum of acoustical results from an orchestra with 
the most appropriate minimum choreographic gestures. In a pub­
lic setting, the conductor connects not just with the members of 
the orchestra but also with the audience attending the concert. 
The gestures shaped by his entire upper-body equipment - includ­
ing hands, arms, shoulders, head, and eyes - are decoded by the 
players and transformed into sound, which is then fed back to the 
audience. (Operatic conductors also often mouth lyrics . )  As the 
eminen t pianist Charles Rosen recently wrote : ' For all of us, music 
is bodily gesture as well as sound, and its primitive connection with 
dance is never entirely distilled away. ' 

The functional advantages or disadvantages of the different chan­
nels of communication have never been fully analysed,  but certain 
statements can be made about acoustic communication in these 
respects which , other things being equal , apply to animals including 
man.  A clear disadvan tage, in contrast for instance to molecular 



Basic Notions 17 

traces such as pheromones (chemical messengers) , which tend to 
persist over time,  is the short-lived character of sound.  To counter­
act this transience ,  humans eventually had recourse to writing and, 
more recently, introduced all sorts of sound-recording devices. This 
apparent  defect may be outweighed by several advantages sound has 
over other media. For one thing, sound is independent of light and 
therefore can be used day or night. For another, i t  fills the entire 
space around the source.  Accordingly, it does not  require a straight 
line of connection with the destination.  Moreover, i t  involves a 
minuscule expenditure of energy. In most animals, the body alone 
produces sound - ordinarily, no tool is requisite . In the case of 
humans, i t  can also be modulated to vary from intimate whisper to 
long-distance shouting. 

In summarizing what is known of the acoustic behaviour of ver­
tebrates, we can only scratch the surface here . Among fish, as in 
the insects, sound production seems to occur but sporadically. 
Almost all instances are in the Teleosts, and their methods are of 
three distinct kinds: by stridulation of one hard part against 
another (grinding their teeth ,  for instance) ;  by expulsion of gas (a 
sort of breathing sound) ; or by vibrating their gas bladder. Some 
fish hiss like a cat, some growl , some grunt like a pig; others croak, 
snore , or croon ; some bellow, purr, buzz, or whistle ;  one even 
vibrates like a drum. And of course fish can hear (although their 
auditory powers vary considerably) . 

Most amphibians cannot hear and seldom produce any sound 
other than a weak squeak, but frogs and toads are quite noisy in 
highly diverse ways. Reptiles can in general hear Letter; yet few 
produce sounds ( though crocodiles roar and grunt) . 

Birds signify by sounds, given and received, but, more compre­
hensively, by so-called displays - stereotyped motor patterns 
involved in communication - which also include visual movements 
and posturing. Birds produce a huge variety of vocalizations, rang­
ing from short, monosyllabic calls, to long, complicated sequences, 
their songs. Some birds can more or less faithfully reproduce , that 
is to say, 'parrot, '  noises of their environment, imitating those of 
other species, notably even speech sounds. The communication 
systems of birds, which have been well studied for many centuries, 



1 8  Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

are so heterogeneous that they cannot be deal t  with here ade­
quately. The same must be said of their multifarious, often daz­
zling, visible displays - stereotyped motor patterns - including 
their sometimes spectacular plumage (e .g. , in peacocks or birds of 
paradise) and their constructs ( as in bowerbirds) .  

Mammals have elaborate auditory organs and rely on the sense 
of hearing more than do members of any other group, but they 
also,  like many birds, communicate , if sporadically, by nonvocal 
methods as well .  A familiar example of this is the drumming behav­
iour in the gorilla, produced by clenched fists beating on the chest. 
Echolocation refers to the phenomenon where the emitter and 
receiver of a train of sounds is the same individual ; this is found in 
bats as well as marine mammals, such as certain species of whales 
and dolphins. (The capability of blind people to navigate by 
echolocation has not been proved. )  Some vertebrates, like rats, 
mice ,  gerbils, and hamsters ,  communicate in a range inaudible to 
normal human hearing, by ultrasonic calls. (Analogously, the most 
effective colour for the social bees seems to be ultraviolet, outside 
the spectrum of unaided human vision . )  

All carnivores (cats, dogs, hyenas, etc . )  as well a s  all primates 
more or less vigorously vocalize, including man 's closest relatives, 
the apes. But the characteristic performances of these creatures 
are both so rich and varied - from the relatively silent orangutans 
to the remarkably diverse ' singing' gibbons - that describing them 
would demand a book-length treatment. Instead of attempting to 
even sketch these here, it 's worth emphasizing that apes do not 
communicate verbally in  the wild and that, furthermore ,  even the 
most strenuous undertakings to inculcate any manifestation of any 
natural language in captive apes - contrary to insistent claims 
m ade in the media - have uniformly failed. 

Attempts to teach language-like skills to apes or to any other ani­
mals  (such as captive marine  mammals or pet birds) have been 
extensively criticized on the grounds that the Clever Hans effect, 
or fallacy, might have been at  work (as mentioned above) .  Since 
this phenomenon has profound implications for (among other 
possible dyads) man-animal communications of all sorts ,  some 
account seems in order here .  In brief, a stallion named Hans, 



Basic Notions 1 9  

in Berlin a t  the turn o f  the century, was reputed to b e  able to 
do arithmetic and perform comparably impressive verbal feats, re­
sponding nonverbally to spoken or written questions put to him by 
tapping out the correct answers with his foot. Ingenious tests even­
tually proved that the horse was in fact reacting to nonverbal cues 
unwittingly given by the questioner. Ever since that demonstration 
of how unintended cueing can affect an experiment on animal 
behaviour, alert and responsible scientists have tried to exclude the 
sometimes highly subtle perseverance of the effect. 

It later turned out that there are two variants of the Clever Hans 
fallacy: those based on self-deception, indulged in by Hans's 
owner/ trainer and other interrogators; and those performances ­
with 'wonder horses, '  ' talking dogs , '  and ' learned'  pigs or geese -
based on deliberate trickery, performed by stage magicians and 
common con 'artists' (over many centuries) . Deceptive nonverbal 
signalling pervades the world of animals and men.  In animals, 
basic shapes of unwitting deception are known as mimicry. 

This is usually taken to include the emulation of dangerous 
models by innocuous mimics in terms of visible or auditory signals,  
or distasteful scents, in order to fool predators. In humans, decep­
tive communications in daily life have been studied by psycholo­
gists, and, on the stage, by professional magicians. Various body 
parts may be mendaciously entailed, singly or in combination: 
gaze, pupil dilation,  tears, winks, facial expression, smile or frown, 
gesture , posture , voice, etc .  

A consideration of mainly acoustic events thus far should by no 
means be taken for neglect of o ther channels in which nonverbal 
messages can be encoded, among them chemical, optical ,  tactile , 
electric, and thermal. The chemical channel antedates all the oth­
ers in evolution and is omnipresent  in all organisms. Bacterial 
communication is exclusively chemical . 

Plants interact with other plants via the chemical channel, and 
with animals (especially insects, but humans as well ) , in addition to 
the usual contact channels, by optical means. While the intricacies 
of plan t communication ( technically known as phytosemiosis) can 
not be further explored here ,  mention should at least be made of 
two related fields of interest: the pleasant minor semiotic artifice 



20 Signs:  An Introduction to Semiotics 

of floral arrangements ;  and the vast domain of gardens as major 
nonverbal semiosic constructs. Formal gardens, landscape gar­
dens, vegetable gardens, water gardens, coral gardens, and Zen 
gardens are all remarkable nonverbal contrivances, which are 
variously cultivated from Malinowski ' s  Trobriands to traditional 
Japanese kare sansui (dry garden) , to Islamic lands, China, and, 
notably so, in France and Britain .  

Smell (olfaction, odour, scent, aroma) is used for purposes of 
communication crucially, say, by sharks and hedgehogs, social 
insects such as bees, termites, and ants, and such social mammals 
as wolves and lions. I t  is less important in birds and primates, 
which rely largely on sight. In modern societies, smell has been 
roundly commercialized in the olfactory management of food and 
toiletry commodities, concerned with repulsive body odour and 
the effects of tobacco products. Perfumes are often associated with 
love and sexual potency. 

The body by itself can be a prime tool for communication , ver­
bal as well as nonverbal . Thus, in animals, it is well known that dogs 
and cats display their bodies in acts of submission and intimida­
tion,  as famously pictured in Charles Darwin's  ( 1 872) book on The 
Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. There are many strik­
ing illustrations in Desmond Morris ' s  ( 1 969) field guide The 
Human Zoo, and in the photos assembled by Weldon Kees (Ruesch 
and Kees 1 956) of how the human frame is brought habitually into 
play. Professional wrestling is popular entertainment masquerad­
ing as a sport that features two or a group of writhing bodies, 
groaning and grunting, pretending in a quasi-morality play of 
good vs evil to vie for victory; the players obviously interact with 
one another, but, more subtlety, communicate with a live audi­
ence.  Such performances differ from legitimate bouts involving 
boxing or collegiate wrestling, or sports like tennis matches, and 
group events ,  such as soccer or cricket, in that the outcome of the 
contest is hardly in suspense . 

D ance is one sophisticated art form that can express human 
thought and feeling through the instrumentality of the body in 
many genres and in many cultures .  One of these is Western bal­
let, which intermingles sequences of hand and limb gestural ex-



Basic Notions 2 1  

changes with flowing body movements and a host o f  o ther non­
verbal protocols that echo one another, like music, costumes, light­
ing, masks, scenery, wigs, etc. Dance and music usually accompany 
pantomime or dumb shows. Silen t  clowns or mimes supplement 
their body movements by suitable make-up and costuming. 

Facial expressions - pouting, the curled lip, a raised eyebrow, 
crying, flaring nostrils - constitute a powerful , universal communi­
cation system, solo or in concert. Eye work, including gaze and 
mutual gaze,  can be particularly powerful in understanding a 
range of quotidian vertebrate as well as human social behaviour. 
Although the pupil response has been observed since antiquity, in 
the last couple of decades it has matured into a broad area of 
research called pupillometry. Among circus animal trainers it  has 
long been an unarticulated rule to carefully watch the pupil move­
ments of their charges, for instance tigers, to ascertain their mood 
alteration.  Bears, on the contrary, are reported to be 'unpredict­
able , '  hence dangerous, precisely because they lack the pupil dis­
play as well as owing to their inelastic muzzle,  which thus cannot 
' telegraph'  an imminent attack. In interpersonal relationships 
between human couples a dilation in pupil size acts in effect as an 
unwitting message transmitted to the other person (or an object) 
of an in tense, often sexually toned, interest. 

Many voluminous dictionaries, glossaries, manuals, and source 
books exist to explicate and illustrate the design and meaning of 
brands, emblems, insignia, signals, symbols, and other signs (in the 
literal ,  tangible sense ) , including speech-fixing signs such as script 
and punctuation, numerical signs, phonetic symbols, signatures, 
trademarks, logos, watermarks, heraldic devices, astrological signs, 
signs of alchemy, cabalistic and magical signs, talismans, technical 
and scientific signs (as in chemistry) , pictograms, and other such 
imagery, many of them used extensively in advertising. Regulatory 
signs (No Smoking) , direction signs deployed at airports (Passport 
Control, Men, Women) or in hospitals (Pediatrics) , international road 
signs (No Passing) are commonly supplemented by icons under the 
pressure of the need for communication across language barriers, 
certain physical impairments, or comparable handicaps. 

The labyrinthine ramifications of optical communication in the

world of animals and for humanity are boundless and need to be 
dealt with separately. Such sciences as astronomy and the visual 
arts have , since prehistoric times, naturally and mainly unfolded in 
the optical channel .  Alterations of the human body and its physical 
appearance , from n on-permanent, such as body painting or theat­
rical make-up or routine hair service, to quasi-permanent meta­
morphoses, by dint of  procedures such as body sculpture , e .g . ,  the 
past Chinese ' lotus foot' or Western ' tight-lacing'  customs; infibu­
lation, cicatrization, or tattooing; and,  more generally, plastic sur­
gery, all convey messages - frequently, as reconstruction, cosmetic 
in intent, in female breast size - by nonverbal means. The art of 
mummy painting in Roman Egypt was intended to furnish surro­
gates for the head by which to facilitate silent communication of a 
deceased individual during his or her passage to the afterlife .  

An intriguing variety of  nonverbal human communicative­
behaviour-at-a-remove features a bizarre form of barter known 
since Herodotus, modern instances of which are still reported, and 
labelled by ethnographers ' silent trade . '  None of the common 
direct channels are usually involved, only the abstract idea of 
exchange. What happens is something like this: one party to a 
commercial transaction  leaves goods at a prearranged place , then 
withdraws to a hidden vantage point to watch unobserved - or 
more likely not. The other party then appears and inspects the 
commodity left behind .  If satisfied by the find, it leaves a compara­
ble amount of some o ther articles of trade . 

The study of spatial and temporal bodily arrangemen ts (some­
limes called proxemics) in personal rapport, the proper dimensions 
of a cage in the zoo or of a prison cell, the layout of offices, class­
rooms, hospital wards, exhibitions in museums and galleries, and 
myriad other architectural designs all involve the axiology of vol­
ume and duration.  A map is a graphic representation of a milieu, 
containing both pictorial or iconic and non-pictorial or symbolic 
elements, ranging fro m  a few simple configurations to highly com­
plex blueprints or other diagrams and mathematical equations. All 
maps are also indexical. They range from the local, such as the 
well-known multicol oured representation of the London under­
ground, to the intergalactic metal plaque on the Pioneer 1 0  space-

craft speeding its way out of our solar system. All organisms 
communicate by use of models ( UmwelfB, or self-worlds, each 
according to its species-specific sense organs) , from the simplest 
representations of manoeuvres of approach and withdrawal to the 
most sophisticated cosmic theories of Newton and Einstein. It  
would be well to recall that Einstein originally constructed his 
model of the universe out of nonverbal signs, ' of visual and some 
of muscular type . '  As he wrote to a colleague in 1 945 : 'The words 
or the language , as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play 
any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which 
seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or 
less clear images which can be "voluntarily" reproduced and com­
bined . '  Later, ' only in a secondary stage , '  after long and hard 
labour to transmute his nonverbal construct into ' conventional 
words and other signs, '  was he able to communicate it to others.

The Study of Signs 

Consider what these ten little dramas have in common:  

• A radiologist spots a silhouette on a chest X-ray photograph of a 
patient and diagnoses lung cancer. 

• A meteorologist notes a rise in barometric pressure and delivers 
the next day's forecast taking that change into account. 

• An anthropologist observes a complex of ceremonial exchanges 
practised among members of a tribe; she draws analytical insights 
into the polity, economy, and social organization of the people 
she is studying. 

• A French-language teacher holds up a picture of a horse . His 
American pupil says, 'Horse . '  The teacher shakes his head and 
pronounces, 'Cheval. ' 

• A historian takes a look at the handwriting of a former president  
and therefrom gains insight into her  subject's personality. 

• A Kremlin watcher, in the former Soviet  Union , observes the 
proximity of a member of the politburo to the party secretary on 
May Day and surmises the member's current status. 

• A compromising fingerprint is introduced as evidence in a trial ; 
the defendant is convicted on that evidence . 



26 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

• A hunter  notices in the snow sets of rectangular tracks of 
pointed hoofs wi th an impression of dew claws; the forefoot 
track is 1 5  cm long and 13 cm broad, and the corresponding 
measurements for the hind-foot track are 15 cm and 1 1  cm. 
There are spherical droppings on the trail 20-30 mm long and 
1 5-20 m m  broad. The hunter surmises, with a high degree of 
probability, that a fully grown bull elk is trotting ahead of him. 

• A man finds himself being stared at by a dog, growling, barking, 
head held high and neck arched, lips contracted vertically 
and teeth bared,  ears erect and turned forward. The man con­
cludes he is in danger of imminent attack and takes evasive 
action. 

• A peacock displays to a susceptible peahen; she circles rapidly 
and squats. Coition ensues. 

Those of us who practise semiotics tend to treat these happenings 
the same way despite their manifest substantive differences of set­
ting, cast of human or speechless characters, and many other vari­
ables.  What enti tles  us to do so is an abstractive operation which 
r�,solves each episode to an instance of semiosis, or sign action. In 
this view, se,p;liotics is not  about the ' real '  world at all , but about 
complementary or alternative actual models of it  and - as Leibniz 
thought - about an infinite number of anthropologically conceiv­
able possible worlds. Thus semiotics never reveals what the world is, 
but circumscribes what we can know about it; in other words, what 
a semiotic model depicts is not ' reality' as such,  but nature as 
unveiled by our m e thod of questioning. It is the interplay between 
' the book of nature ' and its human decipherer that is at issue . The 
distinction may be pictured by the simile of a fisherman casting his 
net; the size of the fish he can catch is limited by the morphology 
of the net, but this  fact does not  provide tutorage in ichthyology. 
A concept o f  ' m odelling systems'  has been central to the semiotics 
of the so-called M oscow-Tartu school since the 1 960s, but, having 
been derived from a representation of language in structural lin­
guistics, i t  has focused on culture to the exclusion of the rest of 



The Study of Signs 27 

nature .  In the age-old philosophical quest for reality, two alterna­
tive points of departure have been suggested: that the structure of 
being is reflected in semiotic structures,  which thus consti tute mod­
els, or maps, of reality; or that the reverse is the case , namely, that 
semiotic structures are independent  variables so that reality 
becomes the dependent variable .  Although both views are beset by 
many difficulties, a version of the second,  proposed by the remark­
ably seminal Estonian biologist Jakob von Uexkiill ( 1 864-1 944) , 
under the watchword Umwelt-Forschung - approximately translated 
as ' re-search in subjective universes '  - has proved to be in best con­
formity with modern semiotics (as well as with ethology) . The same 
attitude was expressed by Niels Bohr when he answered an objec­
tion that reality is more fundamental than the language it under­
lies; Bohr replied:  'We are suspended in language in such a way that 
we cannot say what is up and what is down ' (French and Kennedy 
1985: 302 ) . Signs have acquired their effectiveness through evolu­
tionary adaptation to the vagaries of the sign wielder's Umwelt. 
When the Umwelt changes, these signs can become obstacles, and 
the signer, extinct. 

�_B_!()logical Approach to the Study of Signs 

According to the incomparable philosopher and polymath Charles 
Sanders Peirce ( 1 839-1 9 1 4) ,  who �as justly been called ' the most 
original and the most versatile intellect that the Americas have so 
far produced '  (Fisch 1 980: 1 )  and who uniquely reinvigorated 
semiotics, the antique doctrine of signs, semiosis involves an irre­
d�cibly triadic relation among a sign, its object, and its interpret­
ant. This trio of terms and their next of kin have far-resounding 
philosophical overtones. Before rehearsing some of these, let me 
dwell on a common definition of semiotics and pause to consider 
its components and a few of its consequences. The;: subject matter 
of semiotics, it is often credited, is the exchange of any messages 
wh<;ttsoever - in a word, communicatio";'. 'To this must at once be 
added that semiotics is also focally concerned with the study of sig­
nification. Semiotics is therefore classifiable as that pivotal branch 
of an integrated science of communication to which its character 



28 Signs:  An Introduction to Semiotics 

as a methodical inquiry into the nature and constitution of codes 
provides an indispensable counterpoint. 

A message is a sign or a string of signs transmitted from a sign 
producer, or ;source, to a sign receiver, or destination. Any source 
or any destination is a living entity or the product of a l iving 
entity, such as a computer, a robot, automata in general , or a post­
ulated supernatural being, as when a boy (source) ,  on bent knees 
(non-verbal message) , beseeches his deity (destination) , ' I  pray 
the Lord my soul to take ' (verbal message) .  It is important to real­
ize that only living things and their inanimate extensions undergo 
semiosis, which thereby becomes uplifted as a necessary, if not suf­
ficient, criterial attribute of life .  By ' living things ' are meant not 
just  the organisms belonging to one of the five kingdoms, consist­
ing of the Monera, Protoctista, Animalia, Plantae , and Fungi , but 
also their hierarchically developed choate component parts, 
beginning with a cell , the minimal semiosic unit, estimated to cor­
respond to about fifty genes, or about one thousand billion ( 1 0 12) 
intricately organized atoms. (Viruses are omitted because they are 
neither cells nor aggregations of cells . )  Our bodies are assem­
blages of cells, about one hundred thousand billion ( 1 0 14) of 
them, harmoniously attuned to one another by an incessant flux 
of vital messages. The origin of nucleated cells is a dimly appre­
hended story of the symbiotic and semiosic collaboration among 
single cells - populations of blue algae and bacteria without 
apparent  internal components; they evolved less than one billion 
years after the formation of Earth ( and ample traces of them were 
harvested in Greenland) . Simple cells, it is  thought, fused to form 
the complex confederations of cells composing each living being. 
They, in turn,  are integrated into organs,  organs into organisms, 
forming social systems of ever-increasing complexity. Thus, phys­
ics, biology, psychology, and sociology each embodies its own 
peculiar level of semiosis. The genetic code governs the exchange 
of messages on the cellular level ;  hormones and neurotransmit­
ters mediate among organs and between one another ( the 
immune defence system and the central nervous system are inti­
mately inter-wreathed by a dense flow of two-way message traffic) ; 
and a variety of non-verbal and verbal messages conjoin organisms 



The Study of Signs 29 

into a network of relations with each other as well as with the rest 
of their environment. As Fran�ois Jacob picturesquely described 
( 1 974: 320) the progression ,  ' from family organization to mod­
ern state , from ethnic group to coalition of nations, a whole series 
of integrations is based on a variety of cultural , �oral, social , 
political, economic, military and religious codes. The history of 
mankind is more or less the history of these integrons and the 
way they form and change . '  Semiosis on a superior level in the 
hierarchy of integrons is reducible to that on a lower level ,  
namely, ultimately to physics (Popper and Eccles 1 977) . 

The semiosic comportment of even the major organismic 
groupings,  with differing lifestyles, has been unevenly studied. In 
the web of nature , plants are , above all ,  producers; an examination 
of their communicative behaviour, under the banner of ' phyta­
semiotics, ' began only in 1 98 1 , when the German semiotician Mar­
tin Krampen published an insightful programmatic article under 
that title .  The polar opposites of plants are the fungi ,  nature 's  
decomposers; our knowledge of their peculiar brand of semiosis is 
even more rudimentary. Primary interest has hitherto focused on 
animals (zoosemiotics) , the ingesters, which mediate between the 
other two and,  according to what they consume, may be catego­
rized either as herbivores or predators; their nutritional mode 
may also mark the character of their respective reliance on sign 
use . 

Note the message traffic in four out of the five kingdoms is exclu­
sively non-verbal ; verbal messages have been found only in animals 
and there surge solely in one extant subspecies, Homo sapiens 
sapiens. The most distinctive trait of humans is that only they, 
throughout terrestrial life ,  have two separate , although, of course , 
thoroughly commingled, repertoires of signs at their disposal :  the 
non-verbal - demonstrably derived from their mammalian (espe­
cially primate )  ancestry - and a uniquely human verbal overlay. 
The latter constitutes the subject matter of the most advanced and 
highly formalized branch of semiotics, general linguistics, the study 
of verbal commerce and its subjacent grammatical foundation.  

The definition advanced here presupposes a message producer, 
or source, and a message receiver, or destination .  In the examples 



30 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

above, extant or formerly alive sources and destinations figure in  
such roles as  those of  patient and physician ; e thnographic field­
worker and informants; teacher and pupil; historian and late pub­
lic figure; remote foreign official and political scientist; elk and 
hunter; dog and potential victim;  peacock and peahen. The 
barometer read by the weather forecaster is a human-made instru­
ment of observation , one of a class of sense-enhancing devices, 
such as a bubble chamber, constructed to render ineffable mes­
sages effable ;  thus no physicist can really ' see ' subatomic particles, 
not even aided by the most powerful electron microscope ( or 
accelerator-detector complex) , but only (in the simple case ) the 
tiny bubbles of hydrogen produced by them - the vaporous beads 
in the tank ' stand for, ' that is, model, their interactions. As for the 
dermatoglyph presented to the court, this functions here as a pro­
batively synecdochic message-by-contiguity about the guilt of a pre­
sumed criminal. 

In any given transaction, a source is necessarily coupled by means 
of a channel to a destination; the variety of such passageways is con­
strained by the specific sensorium of each . This state of affairs was 
neatly summed up by George Dalgarno ( the Scottish author of Ars 
signorum, a fascinating semiotic treatise from the mid-seventeenth 
century) : ' I t  is true , '  he wrote in 1 680, ' that all the Senses are Intel­
ligencers to the Soul less or more; for tho they have their distinct 
limits, and proper Objects assigned them by nature ; ye t she is able 
to use their service even in the most abstracted Notions, and Arbi­
trary institution . '  Dalgarno adds that ' nature seems to have fitted 
two, Hearing and Seeing, more particularly for her service , '  but this 
is a superficial view. By far the most hoary  messages are molecular, 
and the chemical channel is the most prevalent. Three of the hier­
archical levels of basic endosemiotic control are regulated, respec­
tively, by the genetic code , by humoral as well as cell-mediated 
immune reactions, and ( since the appearance of the sponges) by 
the large number of pep tides present in the central nervous system,  
functioning as  neurotransmitters. The olfactory and gustatory 
senses are likewise semiochemical . Even in vision,  the impact of 
photons on the retina differentially affects the capacity of the pig­
ment rhodopsin , which fills the rods to absorb l ight of different 



The Study of Signs 31  

wavelengths, the condition for the univariance principle. Acoustic 
and tactile vibrations, and impulses delivered via the thermal 
senses, are , as well , finally transformed into electrochemical mes­
sages. Humans and many other animals are routinely linked by sev­
eral channels simultaneously or in succession .  Parallel processing 
of messages introduces a degree of redundancy, by virtue of which 
it becomes more likely that errors in reception will be minimized; 
however, it is also possible for collimated messages to contradict 
one another - this is how a rhetorical figure such as irony performs 
in spoken or written discourse , as does the back-arch display of a 
house cat in zoosemiotics. 

Messages 

It)s unknown how most sources generate - or, to use a less over­
burdened term , formulate - a message. Human beings are capable 
of launching an enormous number of novel messages appropriate 
to an indefinite variety of contexts,  but the electrochemical intri­
cacies of their initial entrainment by that cramped globe of tis­
sue known as the brain remain an enigma. Plainly, however, the 
message-as-formulated must undergo a transductive operation to 
be externalized into serial strings appropriate to the channel, 
or channels, selected to link up with the destination . This neuro­
biological transmutation from one form of energy to another is 
called encoding. When the destination detects and extracts the 
encoded messages from the channel,  another transduction, fol­
lowed by a series of still further transformations, must be effected 
before interpretation can occur; this pivotal reconversion is called 
decoding. Encoding and decoding imply a code , a set of unambigu­
ous rules whereby messages are convertible from one representa­
tion to another; the code is what the two parties in the message 
exchange are supposed to have , in fact or by assumption , totally or 
in part, in common. Using Joseph Weizenbaum's famous computer 
program, aptly named Eliza, human interlocutors tend to project 
sympathy, interest, and intelligence upon Eliza, as they would upon 
a psychotherapist. In fact, Eliza 'knows' nothing. A similar fallacy 
about shared codes is the theme ofJerzy Kosinski 's  brilliant novel-

e Ue Being There (and the fai thful  movie based on it) , in which an 
i l l i terate , re tarded gardener is ascribed supreme g nostic attributes 
because he - essen tially a blank page - mimics, echoes, and reflects 
back the interactive codes of every one of his conversational part­
ners, whatever their native speech community may be. 

Receivers interpret messages as an amalgam of two separate 
but inextricably blended inputs :  the physical triggering sign , or sig­
nal ,  i tself, but as unavoidably shaped by context. The latter plays a 
cardinal role ,  ye t the concept has eluded definition ;  too , it is gener­
ally unknown how destinations ' take into account '  context. In semi­
otics the term is used both broadly and loosely to encompass 
preceding messages (anaphoric presuppositions) , and probably suc­
ceeding messages (cataphoric implicatures) , environmental and sem­
an tic noise , all fil tered by short- and long-term memory, genetic and 
cul tural. 

The Sign 

These six key factors - messages and code , source and destination,  
channel and context - separate ly and toge ther make up the rich 
domain of semiotic researches.  However, the pivotal notion 
remains the sign. This term has been defined in  many different  
ways since its in troduction in ancien t  Greece. In medical semiotics, 
for example, sign has been used in conjunction with , or ,  rather, in 
opposition to , symptom since at least Alcmaeon , Hippocrates, and 
especially Galen (A.D. c . 1 30-c .200) . Clin ical prac ti tioners usually 
distinguish between ' soft data , '  or subjective sign s ,  dubbed symp­
toms, meaning by th is whatever the patient  relate s  verbally about 
his/ her feelings ( ' I have a pain in my chest ' ) or exhibits non-ver­
bally (groans while poin ting to the chest) ; and ' hMd data , '  or 
objective signs ,  wllich cl inicians actually call ' sign s , '  meaning what­
�yer the physician observes with his/her eyes and ears ( bloody spu­
tum ,  wheezing) or wi th his/her  instruments (sh adow on an X-ray 
photograph ) .  M any phi losophers also use the term sign; however, 
not a few con trast i t  with symbol rather than wi th sym p tom. The 
neo-Kan tian , twen tie th-cen tury ph ilosopher Ernst  Cassirer ( 1 874-
1945 ) , for instance ,  claimed that these two notions belonged to dif-



The Study of Signs 33 

ferent universes of discourse, and that 'a sign is a part of the physi­
cal world, a symbol is a part of the human world of meaning' 
(Cassirer 1 944: 32) . Minimalist approaches such as these are far 
too imprecise and superficial to be serviceable, as Peirce painstak­
ingly demonstrated throughout his voluminous writings. For 

r Peirce, sign was a generic concept, of which there ar� a_ very large 
n!!!Ilber of species, multiplying from a trichotomous base of icon, 
index, and symbol, each defined according to that sigp categQr)" s, 
relation to its object in a particular context. 

To clarify what a sign is, it  is useful to begin with the medieval 
formula aliquid stat pro aliquo, broadened by Peirce , about 1 897,  to 
something which stands to somebody for something in some 
respect or capacity. To the classic notion of substitution featured in 
this famous phrase - Roman Jakobson called it renvoi, translatable 
as ' referral ' -' Peirce here added the criterion of interpretation. At 
this point, le t us take a closer look at the object-sign-interpretant 
trichotomous cycle alluded to earlier, and also pause to consider 
Peirce's ' somebody, ' the destination or other receiver of the 
message . 

The initial distinction between pbject (0) and sign (S) raises 
profound questions about the anatomy of reality, indeed about its 
v«ry existence, but there is nothing approaching a consensus 
about these riddles among physicists ,  let alone ph ilosophers.  One 
obvious implication of this postulated duality is that semiosis 
requires at least two actants: the observer and the observed.  Our 
intuition of reality is a consequence of a mutual interaction 
between the two: Jakob von U exkiill ' s private world of elemen tary 
sensations (Merkzeichen, ' perceptual signs ' )  coupled to their mean­
ingful transforms into action impulses ( Wirkzeichen, ' operation 
signs ' ) ; and the phenomenal world ( Umwelt) , that is, the subjective 
world each animal models out of its ' true ' environment (Natur, 
'reality' ) ,  which reveals itself solely through signs .  The rules 
and laws to which those sign processes - namely, semiosis - are 
subject are the only actual laws of nature . 'As the activity of our 
�ind is the only piece of nature known to us,' he argued in his 
great work, Theoretical Biology, ' i ts laws are the only ones that have 
the right to be called laws of Nature ' (Uexkiill 1 973 [ 1 928] : 40) . 



34 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

Any observer's version of his/her Umwelt will be one unique model 
of the world, which is a system of signs made up of genetic factors 
plus a cocktail of experiences, including future expectations. A 
complicating fact of life is that the bare act of observation entails a 
residual juncture that disturbs the system being observed. The 
essential ingredient, or nutriment, of mind may well be informa­
tion,  but to acquire information about anything requires, via a 
long and complex chain of steps, the transmission of signs from 
the object of interest to the observer's central nervous system. Its 
attainment, moreover, takes place in such a manner that this influ­
ential action reacts back upon the object being observed so as to 
perturb its condition . In brief, the brain,  or mind, which is itself a 
system of signs, is linked to the putative world of objects, not sim­
ply by perceptual selection, but by such a far-off remove from 
physical inputs - sensible stimuli - that we can safely assert that 
the only cognizance any animal can possess, ' through a glass, 
darkly, ' as it were, is that of signs.  Whether there is a reality 
behind signs - perhaps what Heracli tus called logos, the repeatable 
structure that secures for any object i ts ideal unity and stability, 
and which the French topologist Rene Thorn ( 1 975) and I have 
independently rendered as 'form' - humanity can never be sure . 
As Heraclitus so eloquently put it, 'You could not discover the lim­
its of soul , even if you travelled every road to do so;  such is the 
depth of its form. '  In  sum, this reasoning enti tles us to rewrite 0 
as So 

n ' so that the initial twofold distinction is resolved to one 
• 

between two sorts of signs.  
What about the third correlate , Peirce 's  interpretant ( I ) ? What 

did he mean by th is much-discussed (and even more often misun­
derstood) concept? True , no single, canonical definition of it is to 
be found in his writings, bU,t he does make it clear that every sign 
determines an interpretant 'which is itself a sign , [so that] we,have 
a sign overlying sign . '  He also points out that an interpretant can 
be either an equivalent sign or ' perhaps a more developed sign , '  
which i s  where novelty enters the system,  enabling us  to increase 
our understanding of the immediate object. To illustrate all this, 
ponder some interpretants of the English noun horse. They could 
be ( partial)  synonyms such as colt, gee-gee, gelding, hinny, mare, pony, 



The Study of Signs 35 

stallion, stud, thoroughbred - to say nothing of heroin - and the l ike,  
or the interpretant  could be a monolingual rewording, including 
standard dictionary definitions,  such as the OED's :  'A sol id-hoofed 
perissodactyl quadruped . . .  having a flowing mane and tai l ,  whose 
voice is a neigh . '  Another of its in terpre tan ts is the scien tific name 
Equus Przewalski caballus, as are all ( roughly) equivalen t transla­
tions  in to verbal signs in other languages ,  such as cheval, Pfred, 
losad, hevonen, and so forth .  Historical tokens, such as Bucephalus, 
Morocco,  Clever Hans, and all the Lipizzaners of the Spanish 
Riding School of Vienna belong here ,  as do such l i terary represen­
tations as Dean Swift 's  Houyhnhnms,  Peter Shaffer ' s  play Equus, 
Conan Doyle 's saga Silver Blaze, Eco 's  creature Brunellus,  and 
entire scien tific treatises as different  as Xenophon ' s  disquisition 
Treatise on Horsemanship, Stefan von Maday's  Psyrhologie der Pferde 
und der Dressur, and E . H .  Gombrich ' s  penetrating essay ' Medita­
tions on a Hobby Horse . '  Intersemiotic transmutations  in to non­
verbal signs include innumerable and worldwide engravings and 
pain tings of horses (notably from the Magdalenian caves) , sculp­
tures ( from the Neolithic period onward , including those of the 
Chinese tradi tion since Lung-shan Scythian friezes, Greek cen­
taurs, as well as modern filmic portrayals such as National Velvet and 
The Black Stallion. Finally, of course , any ' actual ' horse I poin t to 
may become, by virtue of that gesture , wh ich is an indexical sign,  
or an 'objec t of direct experience so far as  i t  directs attention to an 
object by which i ts presence is caused, '  an in terprc tan t. There is no 
doubt that an in tralingual synonym or paraphrase of, or extended 
discourse o n ,  any sign will enrich comprehension of the object it 
represents ,  as will also i ts in terlingual translations and intersemi­
otic transmutations .  Each further in terpretant  tends to amplifY 
intell igence and afford opportuni ty for a cascade of seman tic inno­
vation and therefore change. (Another,  more technical , way of put­
ting th is is that any metalanguage explicating an object language is 
always richer than the latter. ) 

In  brief, i t  fol lows from Peirce ' s  way of looking at the sign that 
the second distinction ,  as much as the first, resolves i tself into two 
sorts of signs, to wit, S and Sin . Once more ,  here are his words: a 
sign is anything 'which determines something else ( i ts interpretant) 



36 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

to refer to an object to which itself refers ( its object) in the same 
way, the sign becoming in turn a sign, and so on ad infinitum. ' 

Signs and 'Reality' 

If objects are signs, in indefinite regression to a.-supposititious logos, 
and if interpretants are signs marching in progression toward the 
ultimate disintegration of mind, what is there left that is not a sign? 
What of the ' somebody' mentioned by Peirce - the observer or the 
interpreter of the train after train of sign actions? In a celebrated 
article he published in 1 868, Peirce anticipated and answered this 
question , contending that ' the word or sign which humans use are 
the humans themselves, ' which is to claim that  the human and the 
t;xternal sign are identical , l in the same sense in which the words 
homo and man are identical . 'Thus my language is the sum total of 
myself, for the man is the thought. ' In short, the 'somebody' is also 
a sign or a text. What of the human being's faculty of procreation , 
shared with all other life forms? Peirce showed that even this 
capacity is inherent in signs, a parallel that has been elaborated by 
Thorn ( 1 973) . Signs come into being only by development out of 
other signs. 
-

The position adverted to in the foregoing paragraphs, according 
to which , at a certain point in the semiosic cycle ,  there are objects, 
included among them conscious observers or interpreters - such 
as people , porpoises, and perhaps Phobians - and there are , at 
another point in the cycle , interpretants, both being kinds of signs, 
is a familiar one in philosophical tradition . This position - one that 
surely follows from Peirce 's wistful, throw-away remark about some­
thing he took to be a fact, ' that the entire universe . . .  is perfused 
with signs, if i t  is not composed exclusively of signs '  - is known as 
idealism, and that of a particular hue, sometimes called ' concep­
tual idealism , '  which maintains that our view of reali ty, namely, our 
Umwelt, entails an essential reference to mind ( Gemut) in its consti­
tution . As Kant insisted - and, of course , both Peirce and Jakob 
von Uexkiill had thoroughly assimilated Kantian principles - ' raw 
experience ' is unattainable ;  experience, to be apprehended, mUSl 
first be steeped in , strained through , and seasoned by a soup of

signs. tor this reason, this brand of idealism can be called ' semi­
otic idealism, '  in the apt designation put forward by the philoso­
pher David Savan ( 1 983) . Furthermore, to paraphrase Savan, 
semiotic idealism comes in two flavours, strong or radical and mild 
or tolerant, between which he leans toward the latter, namely, ' the 
thesis that any properties, attributes, or characteristics of whatever 
exists depend upon the system of signs, representations, or inter­
pretations through which they are signified. ' Without necessarily 
committing oneself to this or that brand of idealism - only the real­
ist positions are , I think, altogether devoid of interest - iJ:. is clear 
th,!t what semiotics is finally all about is the role of mind in the cre­
ation of the world or of physical constructs out of a vast and diverse 
crush of sense impressions. 

'
In 1 984 I was an auditor at an international state-of-the-art con­

ference, co-sponsored by Indiana University and the National 
Endowment for the Humanities. The topic debated was whether 
semiotics is a field or a discipline - a question Umberto Eco had 
suggested in a speech delivered ten years earlier on the Indiana 
campus. Most speakers were specialists in one or more of the com­
plex historical sciences the French call les sciences humaines. The 
designated formal discussant was the late illustrious and sceptical 
English social anthropologist Sir Edmund Leach , who had de­
tected undue hubris in the presentations, pointing out to the 
speakers that ' others were there before you. '  As to that, he was 
undoubtedly correct. Obsessive concern with signs dates from the 
appearance of the most dramatic of all steps in hominoid evolu­
tion, the emergence of verbal signs and the changes in informa­
tion storage and transmission that accompanied that transition . 
The same preoccupation with signs is evident throughout infant 
and child development. When my five-year-old daughter asked me,  
'Daddy, just what does the Salivation Army do? ' and when another, 
who was seven years old, wondered just how Dracula was killed by a 
' steak' driven into his heart, I knew I was not being led into the 
tangled thickets of philanthropy or Transylvania, but into that locus 
classicus of signs in action, paronomasia. 

To conclude this second chapter, a caveat is in order. To say that 
sell,liotics is a 'human '  or 'historical ' science may well perpetuate

an illusion . According to at least one version of quantum theory, 
John Archibald Wheeler's highly imaginative rendition of the so­
called Copenhagen interpretation, the past is theory, or yet 
another system of signs; it 'has no existence except in the records 
of the present. ' At a semiotic level we make the past as well as the 
present and the future .

Six Species of Signs 

In this chapter I will first look at the general features that charac­
terize signs. Then I will delineate a typology of six basic ' species' of 
signs which reflects the types of signs most regularly identified and 
commonly employed by semioticians. 

General Features of Signs 

There are a number of general features of signs that require some 
discussion at length .  These are well-known features that have been 
investigated from various angles over the decades. 

1 .  The Sign Is Bifacial � ) l  - -\* Ti \ 
In 1 305, in his unfinished treatise De vulgari eloquentiae ( 1 957:  1 8) ,  
Dante proffered this formulation of the concept of the (verbal) 
sign: 'hoc equidem signum . . .  sensuale quid est, in quantum sonus 
est: rationale vero , in quan tum aliquid significare videtur ad placi­
tum . '  This restatement is in good conformity with practically every 
model of the intrinsic structure of the sign that, with one emphasis 
or another, has been put forward in accounts dealing with the foun­
dations of the doctrine of signs, ranging from Stoic philosophy to 
contemporary thinking. This expression implies that the sign is con­
sti tuted of two indispensable moieties, one aistheton, perceptible (or 
sensible) , the other noeton, intelligible (or rational) : the signifier, an 
appreciable im pact on at least one of the in terpreter' s sense organs, 



40 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

and the content signijied. (In medieval Latin,  the corresponding 
pair of terms for the Stoic semainon, 'signifier, '  and semainomenon, 
' signified, ' was signans and signatum, rendered by Saussure as signi­
fiant and signijie, in German usually as das Signijikat and dlff Signiji­
kant, by Morris as sign vehicle and designatum, by some Soviet scholars 
[ Revzina 1 972: 23 1 ]  as ' thing' and 'concept, ' etc . )  

2. Zero Signs 

In various systems of signs, notably in language, a sign vehicle can 
sometimes - when the contextual conditions are appropriate - sig­
nify by its very absence , occur, that is, in ZlfOf  form. Linguists who 
e mploy the expression 'zero sign ' ( zero phoneme or allophone,  
zero morpheme or allomorph , and the like ) must mean either 
' zero signifier, ' or, much more rarely, ' zero signified, ' but n ever 
both ;  if taken literally, the notion of a 'zero sign ' would be oxymo­
ronie .  (On the use of zero in linguistics, see J akobson 1 940, 1 9 66; 
Frei 1 950; Godel 1 953; Haas 1 957. )  The role of zero sign vehicles 
in communication systems other than the verbal has never been 
properly analysed. Pohl ( 1 968: 34-5) , for instance , erroneously 
remarks that civilian clothing functions as a zero when worn in a 
context of uniforms; but this confounds the unmarked/marked 
opposition with the realized/zero opposition.  

Zero sign vehicles also occur in animal communication systems. 
Thus Ardrey ( 1 970: 75) claims that the Mrican 'elephant's alarm 
call is silence , '  and so, too, Rene-Guy Busnel that the temporal 
parameter between the message exchanged by two members of the 
species Lanianus lfyf thogaster, that is, ' the rhythmic pattern of 
silences . . .  and not the acoustic part of the signal itself carries  the 
information (Sebeok 1 968: 1 38) . But a heuristically more promis­
ing inquiry is suggested by the quasi-prosodic phenomenon that, 
in several types of fireflies, pulse in terval is a significant element in 
stimulating females, and that these intervals are distinct in differ­
ent species, for example , in Photinus consanguineus and macdermotii; 
in the related lineellus, furthermore , the pulse number is variable , 
'which further indicates the significance of pulse interval ' (Lloyd 
1 9 66:  78) . The existence of zero forms in various systems of c om-

munication does not, therefore , vitiate the classic bipartite model 
of the sign. 

3. Token/Type, Denotation/Designation 

A particular occurrence of a sign - what Peirce labelled ' sinsign ' 
(2 :245) - is now more commonly called a token, whereas the class 
of all occurrences of the sign - Peirce 's  ' legisign ' (8 :363) - is called 
a type. Paraphrasing Peirce 's own illustration, one can say that if a 
page in a book has 250 words upon it, this is the number of word 
tokens, whereas the number of different  words on a page is the 
number of different word types ( this distinction was also explored 
by Richards 1 969) . 

Among the principal questions that have occupied most stu­
dents of the verbal sign, three have seemed basic and inescapable : 
How do particular sign tokens refer? How do sign types acquire and 
maintain their constant capacity to mean? What precisely lies at the 
heart of the distinction between the relation of reference, or deno­
tation, and the relation of meaning, or sense, or designation. A 
fourth question about the relation of meaning and use could also 
be added (Wells 1 954) . The modern cleavage between meaning 
and reference has recurred in many guises since Frege 's  classic 
consideration, in 1 892, of Sinn and Bedeutung- Husserl 's  Bedeutung 
vs Benutzung, Mill ' s  denotation vs connotation, Paul ' s  Bedenkung vs 
Benutzung, Saussure 's  valeur vs substance. ' Semantics' is often ,  if 
loosely, used as a cover term encompassing both the theory of ver­
bal reference and the theory of verbal meaning, but should, in the 
strict sense, be confined to the latter. Analytic philosophers, such 
as Carnap ( 1 942) , typically assign the theory of truth and the the­
ory of logical deduction to semantics, on the ground that truth 
and logical consequence are concepts based on designation, and 
hence seman tic concepts .  The term zoosemiotics was coined in 1 963 
to extend the theory of meaning so as to account for presumably 
corresponding designative processes among the speechless crea­
tures (Sebeok 1 972a: 80) . 

A noticeable discrepancy between what a sign type designates 
and the denotation of one of its tokens may be responsible, on var-

ious levels, for the linguistic processes known to poetics and rheto­
ric as 'figures of speech , '  as well as kindred phenomena found in 
animals (Bronowski 1 967) . This also underlies the mechanism 
involved in lying, which - certain opinions notwithstanding - cor­
responds to various forms of deception found throughout the 
animal kingdom. 

Six Species of Signs 

Recogni tion of the m anifold possible relations between the two 
p¥ts of a sign - the signifier and the signified - has led to numer­
ous attempts by philosophers and philosophically inclined lin­
guists, throughout the history of semiotics, to classity signs or 
systems of signs. Among these, Peirce 's ultimate and maximal 
scheme - which he elaborated slowly but persistently over a period 
of some forty years - with sixty-six varieties, including intermedi­
ates and hybirds, was surely the most comprehensive , far-reaching, 
and subtle (Weiss and Burks 1 945; but see Sanders 1 970) . In the 
verbal field, one of the more thoughtful and suggestive efforts of 
recent times was Bally' s  ( 1 939) , while Jakobson's  ( 1 970) special 
study devoted to the classification of human signs in general once 
again widens the horizons of current semiotic inquiry. Spang­
Hanssen 's  ( 1 954) survey provides a convenient overview of the psy­
chological approaches of Ogden and Richards, Karl Britton,  Ber­
trand Russell, and Charles Morris, as well as linguistic ones by 
scholars as heterogeneous as Ferdinand de Saussure , Leo Weisger­
ber, Alan H. Gardiner, Karl Buhler, Eric Buyssens, Leonard Bloom­
field, and Louis Hjelmslev. Today, only some half a dozen species 
of signs - often with several more or less vaguely sense subspecies -
are regularly identified and commonly employed, wi th but roughly 
comparable definitions; however, in virtually all cases, these are 
considered only over the domain of language and the human 
being's other species-specific systems, say, the secondary modelling 
systems of the Russian semiotic tradition that imply a verbal infra­
structure, or music, or the l ike (Sebeok 1 972a: 1 62-77) . In  what 
follows, the six species of signs that seem to occur most frequently 
in contemporary semiotics will be discussed, provisionally rede-

fined, and i llustrated not only from anthroposemiotic systems ( i .e . ,  
those that are species-specific to humans) , but also zoosemiotic 
systems, in order to show that none of the signs dealt with here is 
criterial of, or unique to, humans. 

I t  should be clearly understood, finally, tha�t is not signs that 
are actually being classified, but more precisely, aspects of signs: in 
otbh words, a given sign may - and , more often than not does -

'
exhibit more than one aspect, so that one must recognize differ­
e�ces in gradation (Eco 1 972a: 201 ) .  But it is equally important to 
grasp that the hierarchic principle is inherent in the architecture 
of any species of sign . For instance , a verbal symbol, such as an 
imperative , is commonly also endowed with a signal value . An 
emblem , which is a subspecies of symbol , may be partly iconic, 
such as the flag of the United States, since its seven red horizontal 
stripes alternating with six white ones stand for each founding col­
ony, whereas i ts fifty white stars in the single blue canton corre­
spond to each state in the Union. A primarily indexical sign, like a 
clock, acquires a discernible symbolic content in addition if the 
timepiece happens to be Big Ben .  In the designs of the Australian 
Walbiri , the iconic bond between the forms of the sign vehicles 
and the referents assigned is  said to be central , for, as Munn ( 1 973: 
1 77) points out, ' there is no systematic subordination of the iconic 
element to a second abstract ordering system, '  in contrast to her­
aldry, where ,  as in a pictorial writing system,  ' the iconic qualities 
linking the visual forms to their meanings tend to be attenuated, '  
that is ,  to become stepwise symbolic, 'because of the overall adjust­
ment of the visual forms to another underlying sociocultural sys­
tem for which the former consti tutes a communication code . '  (For 
the process of deiconization, see Wallis 1 973: 487 . )  Morris 's ( 1 971 : 
l�l ) dictum, ' Iconicity is . . .  a matter of degree , '  coupled with 
Count's ( 1 969: 1 02)  comparably terse formula, ' Symbolization . . .  is 
supposable as a matter of a continuous (qualitative) degree , '  seem 
to sum up the matter adequately. 

To recapitulate , aspects of a sign necessarily co-occur in an envi­
ronment-sensitive hierarchy. Since all signs, of course , enter into 
complex syntagmatic as well as paradigmatic  contrasts and opposi­
tions, it is their place both in the web of a concrete text and the 



44 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

network of an abstract system that is decisive as to which aspect  will 
predominate in a given context at a particular moment, a fact 
which leads directly to the problem of levels,  so familiar to linguis­
tics - being an absolute prerequisi te for any typology - but as yet 
far from developed in the other branches of semiotics. This impor­
tan t issue ( see Lotman and Uspenskij 1 973;  Meletinsky and Segal 
1 9 7 1 ) can only be pointed out here. The sign is legi timately, if 
loosely, labelled after the aspect that ranks predominant. 

Signal 

T�e signal is a sign which mechanically (naturally) or convention­
;:tHy (artificially) tI;iggers some reaction on the part of a receiver. 
This is in accordance with the view that ' signals may . . .  be provided 
by nature , but they may also be produced artificially' (Kecskemeti 
1 952:  36) . Note that the receiver can be either a machine or an 
organism, conceivably, even a personified supernatural (Sebeok 
1972b: 5 1 4) .  

A most interesting and productive re-examination of the con­
cept of signal is to be found in pazukhin ( 1 972) . His argument 
and resultant definition,  which resembles, but is not identical with , 
the one given above , rest on the development of a series of oppo­
sitions, stemming from the need to distinguish the physical ,  or 
technological , notion of signal from the one prevalent  in the 
humanities and social sciences - briefly, from a purely semiotic 
conception; and the need, on the one hand, to separate physical 
phenomena which are signals from the class of non-signals, while , 
on the other hand, to discriminate signals from signs. I t  should be 
noted that Pazukhin wrenches Buhler 's  thesis out of its context 
and dismisses it  out of hand as having given ' rise to numerous 
improper interpretations, which conceive Buhlerian signals as spe­
cies of sig;ns ( Zeichen, after Buhler) , conveying commands, requests 
�d other kinds of imperative messages '  ( 1 972:  28) .  There are two 
fallacies involved here : one is the neglect  of Buhler's so-called 
organon model as a whole , in which the concept of signal takes its 
logical place along with the concepts of symptom and symbol , and 
in isolation from which it cannot  therefore be understood. A more 



Six Species of Signs 45 

serious error is to forget that one must constantly deal with aspects 
of signs: to repeat, a verbal command is very likely to have both a 
symbol-aspect and a signal-aspect, and the sign in question will 
oscillate between the two poles according to the context of its 
delivery. 

I t  may be well to recall what Buhler did say about the signal 
within the framework of his model. In Buhler's view, the signal 
appeals to the destination, whose interior and exterior behaviour i t  
governs; that i s ,  i t  acts, as  i t  were , like a traffic regulator, which elic­
its or inhibits reaction. By contrast, the symptom has to do with the 
source , whose inner behaviour it expresses; and the symbol relates 
to the designation (Buhler 1 934: 28) . 

pazukhin ( 1 972: 29f. )  rightly emphasizes the necessity ' to achieve 
a substantial discrimination of signals and signs, '  and then analyses 
'a few most promising ten tatives, ' including the hypotheses of such 
Russian philosophers or linguists as Abramian, Brudny, and 
Zalizniak, but finds fault  with them all ,  chiefly owing to his con­
viction that none of them offers ' adequate cri teria for a realistic 
opposition of signals to other media of interaction ' ( 1 972 :  30) . In  
my opinion, iUs essential ,  first of all ,  to  realize that the relation of 
signal to  sign is that of a marked category to an unmarked one ,  
that i s ,  precisely that of  a species to  a genus to which it  belongs, as 
Buhler also claimed. Secondly, pazukhin introduces and discusses 
in detail what he calls two modes of control , both of which are inter­
actions based on the idea of causal relationship: direct control and 
block-and-release control . Control by signalling is a special case of 
the latter, which naturally leads to the conclusion , implied by 
pazukhin 's  ( 1 972:  4 1 )  definition of signal , that there 'is only an 
occasional relationship between a signal and reactions produced by 
it. ' This, however, is merely a weak echo of Peirce 's explicit coupling 
of all sign-processes - hence signalling as well - with processes 
involving mediation or ' thirdness . '  Witness the following passage: 

It is important to understand what I mean by semiosis. All dynamical 
action, or action by brute force ,  physical or psychical, either takes place 
between two subjects . . .  or at any rate is a resultant of such actions 
between pairs. But by ' semiosis' I mean, on the contrary, an action, or 



46 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

influence, which is, or involves, a co-operation of three subjects, such as a 
sign , its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in 
any way resolvable into actions between pairs . . .  my definition confers on 
anything that so acts the title of a ' sign . '  (Peirce 5 :484) 

Consider the following: C.R. Carpenter ( 1 969: 44) , a prominent 
student of animal behaviour, writing in connection with allopri­
mates, takes the occasion to define signalling behaviour generally, 
in many quali ties,  forms, and patterns, as ' a  condensed stimulus 
event, a part of a longer whole, which may arouse extended 
actions. Signaling activity, in its simplest form , is  produced by an 
individual organism ; it represents information ; it is mediated by a 
physical carrier, and it is perceived and responded to by one or 
more individuals. Like the stimulus event, of which signalling 
behaviour is a special case , this kind of behaviour releases more 
energy than is used in signaling. ' Now pazukhin ( 1 972: 41 ) rejects 
three cri teria that have been variously proposed for defining sig­
nals, on the ground that they ' cannot be considered essential . '  
These criteria - all of  them used by Carpenter  - are : the presence 
of a certain amount of energy; the delivery of information about 
something; and being dispatched by an animal .  I completely 
endorse the elimination of all three factors from a viable definition 
of signal . 

An example of a signal is the exclamation 'Go ! '  or, alternatively, 
the discharge of a pistol to start a footrace (a conventional releaser 
vs a mechanical trigger) . The term is commo nplace in studies of 
animal communication (Burkhardt 1967, Sebeok 1 968, 1 972a: 
1 35-6 1 ) ,  where it is often used interchangeably with a seldom 
defined zoosemiotic prime, display (e .g. , Smith 1 965 : 405) . 

Symptom 

A symptom is a compulsive , automatic, non-arbitrary sign, such 
that the signifier coupled with the signified in the manner of a 
natural link. A syndrome is a rule-governed configuration of symp­
toms with a stable designatum. Both terms h ave strong, but nut 
exclusively, medical connotations (Ostwald 1 968) ;  thus one can 



Six Species of Signs 47 

say, by metaphoric extension ,  ' the rise of modern anthropology 
was a symptom of colonialism, '  and the like . 

I t  is a peculiarity of symptoms that their denotata are generally 
different for the addresser ( i .e . ,  the patien t - ' subjective symptoms ' )  
than for the addressee ( i .e . ,  the physician - ' objective symptoms' ) . 
In a felicitous phrase of Barthes ( 1 972 :  38) , ' Ie symptome , ce serai t 
Ie reel apparent  ou l 'apparent  reel '  (for some Freudian impli­
cations of this observation see Brown 1 958: 3 1 3  and Kecskemeti 
1 952:  6 1 ;  and for semiotic work in this area see Shands 1 970 and 
Ruesch 1 973) . 

I t  is interesting to note that the subtle Port-Royal logicians drew 
a distinction between ' ordinary' symptoms and what physicians 
would call ''(;i,tal signs, ' on the basis of an essentially quantitative 
criterion (Arnauld and Nicole 1 8 1 6  [ 1 662] ) .  In other words, the 
specification ' compulsive , automatic '  is subject to a probabilistic 
refinement  for, although the denotation of a symptom is always 
equivalent to i ts cause in the source, some symptoms are effectively 
connected with an antecedent condition 'for sure , '  whereas the 
link of other symptoms with the foregoing state of affairs is merely 
assumed with varying degrees of likelihood. 
�IJliotics - referring in earliest usage to medical concerns with 

the sensible indications of changes in the condition of the human 
body - constituted one of the three branches of Greek medicine . 
Sil!�e symptoms were among the earliest signs identified, they con­
stitute a historically important category for any inquiry into the 
beginnings of the theory of signs, for instance, the thinking of such 
physicians as the Alexandrian physiologist Erasistratus ( 3 1 0-250 
B .C . ) ,  the anatomist Herophilus (335-280 B .C . ) , and the Epicurean 
Asclepiades of Bithynnia (fl. 1 1 0  B .C . ) , mentioned, among others, by 
Sextus Empiricus. Symptomatology, or semeiology (Sebeok 1 973b) , 
eventually developed into a branch of medicine with a specialized 
threefold preoccupation with diagnostics, focusing on the here and 
now, and its twin temporal projections into the anamnestic past and 
the prognostic future. A rapprochement between the general the­
ory of, and the medical praxis involving, signs is rather recent, in no 
small way stimulated by the distinguished work of Michel Foucault 
(Barthes 1972: 38) ; but it was, in some measure, remarkably antici-



48 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

pated by Kleinpaul, in 1 888, who paid homage to Hippocrates (460-
377 B.C . )  as the father and m aster of 'Semiotik' in having traced this 
nexus out in its Saussurean pre-figurements;  and emphatically so by 
Crookshank ( 1 925: 337-55) .  

Barthes ( 1 972:  39) , following Foucault, deems it wise to distin­
guish symptom from sign , and chooses to oppose the two within 
the well-known schema of Hjelmslev, whose elaboration on the 
bifacial character of the sign into form and substance, expression 
and content, seems to continue to fascinate Romance-language 
semioticians. Barthes assigns the symptom to the category that 
Hjelmslev called the substance of the signifier, and then goes on to 
argue that a symptom turns into a sign only when it enters in the 
context of clinical discourse , just when this transformation is 
wrought by the physician , in brief, solely ' par la mediation du lan­
gage . '  However, such a view is tenable, if at all ,  only in such special 
cases when the destination of a symptomatic message is a physician 
or, by extension , a ve terinarian, or at least a computer repair tech­
nician . In fact, the destination need be none of these; it could, for 
example, be a speechless creature. Autonomic effects,  that is, 
symptomatic displays, were acutely observed and described by Dar­
win,  and virtually all modern research in both interspecific and 
intraspecific animal communication ultimately rests on passages 
such as his remark that the erection of the dermal appendages, in 
a variety of vertebrates, ' is a reflex action, independent of the will ; 
and this action must be looked at, when occurring under the influ­
ence of anger or fear, not as a power acquired for the sake of some 
advantage , but as an inciden tal result, at least to a large extent, of 
the sensorium being affected.  The result, in as far as it is inciden­
tal , may be compared with the profuse sweating from an agony of 
pain or terror'  in humans (Darwin 1872:  1 0 1 ) .  Human symptoms 
such as these,  and a host of others, can e asily be perceived and 
acted upon by such domesticated animals as dogs and horses (as 
the notorious Clever Hans episode in the history of psychology 
amply bears out, and for which see Hediger 1 967) , and in a varie ty  
o f  other situations in which language does not, indeed,  cannot, 
play any sort of mediating role.  In this global semiotic perspectivL , 
the n ,  it remains my thesis that the opposition of symptom to sign 



Six Species of Signs 49 

parallels that of signal to sign, namely, of a marked category 
(species) to an unmarked one (genus) . 

It is l ikewise fallacious to assume that the function of a symptom 
is invariably morbific: as Kleinpaul ( 1 972:  1 06)  has astutely re­
marked, there must also exist a semiotic of ' radiant' good health,  a 
condition where the organism may be observed, as it were , 'beam­
ing' symptoms of well-being. Thus the exclusive identification of 
symptomatology with nosology can be quite misleading. 

Note that Buhler ( 1 934: fn . 1 )  amplified his term 'Symptom' 
with two quasi-synonymous words, 'Anzeichen'  and ' Indicum, '  and 
that others would actually classifY all symptoms as a subspecies of 
indexes, often with such qualifications as 'unwitting indexes' or 
'mere unintended indexes' (Jakobson 1 970: 1 0) .  The difficulty 
with this suggestion is that the place of ' intention ' - or, more 
broadly, goal-orientation - in a communication model remains an 
entangled and controversial problem (Meiland 1 970) . In the sense 
of self-awareness - so-called ' subjective teleology' - the notion may 
be cri te rial in the definition of anthroposemiotic systems, and 
notably characterizes language, but it  is hardly pertinent to 
zoosemiotic analysis, where introducing i t  may have stultifYing 
effects. A more detailed discussion of intention lies beyond the 
scope of this chapter ( see Sebeok 1973a) . 

Like all signs, symptoms may figure in both paradigmatic systems 
and syntagmatic chains. Investigation of the former role has hith­
erto been rudimentary, but it  will become much better understood 
in this age of computer technology. A syntagmatic concate-nation 
of symptoms can be of two sorts: let us call them topical and tem­
poral . A topical syntagm is made up of a bundle of symptoms man­
ifested simultaneously, say, along different regions of a human 
body. Thus the basic operative parameters in a surgical procedure 
may involve an electrocardiogram, an electroencephalogram, car­
diac output, central venous pressure, peripheral arterial pressure , 
rectal temperature , and respirations, all monitored and inter­
preted synchronously by the attendant  medical team. A temporal 
syn tagm implies input information from the same source , but at 
successive intervals set along the time axis. Thus Hediger ( 1 968: 
1 44) relates that the excrement of giraffes is kept under auditory

observation in zoos as a continuing guide to the animal 's state of 
heal th :  'normally, the falling of faeces should give a typical rustling 
sound, '  he reports, but ' if the excrement is voided in shapeless, 
patterning portions , '  the keeper is alerted to the possible existence 
of a pathological condition.  

I t  might prove quite instructive to explore in much more depth 
such fruitful ideas as the interplay of paradigm and syntagm and of 
the axis of simultaneity with that of successivity, of substitution ver­
sus combination, and the like , in a field different from linguistics 
as (at first blush) symptomatology appears to be (Celan and Mar­
cus 1 973) . Barthes's 1 972 essay is suggestive , but essentially this 
task must await the considerable advancement of semiotics on a 
much broader front. 

Icon 

A. sign is said to be iconic when there is a topological similarity 
b�tween a signifier and its denotata. It was in 1 867, in his papt;r 
'On a New List of Categories, '  that Peirce first published his now 
famous fundamental triad, and initially asserted that there were 
three kinds of signs (or, as he called them, ' representations ' ) : 
(a) likenesses (a term he soon abandoned in favour of icons) , or 
' those whose relation to their objects is a mere community in some 
quality' ; (b) indices, or ' those whose relation to their objects con­
sists in a correspondence in fact' ; and (c )  symbols (which are the 
same as general signs) , or ' those the ground of whose relation to 
their objects is an imputed quali ty, ' which he later called ' laws, '  
meaning conventions, habits,  or natural dispositions of its inter­
pretan t or of the field of its interpretant. 

Peirce later distinguished three subclasses of icons: images, dia­
grams, and metaphors. The notion of the icon - which is ultimately 
related to the Platonic process of mimesis and which Aristotle 
then broadened from a chiefly visual representation to embrace 
all cognitive and epistemological experience - has been subjected 
to much analysis in its several varieties and manifestations, ye t 
some seemingly intractable theoretical questions remain. Image� 
(which are still sometimes simplistically equated with all icons, or 



Six Species of Signs 5 1  

worse, are naively assumed to b e  confined solely to the visual 
sphere) were studied in two exceptionally thoughtful inquiries 
by Eco ( 1 972b) and by Wallis ( 1 973) respectively. As for the theory 
of diagrams, this loomed very large in Peirce 's  own semiotic 
researches, and has been carefully reviewed by Zeman ( 1 964) and 
Roberts ( 1 973) in some of its far-reaching ramifications, which 
include modern graph theory. Peirce did not h imself much pur­
sue the ancient  rhetorical device of metaphor, beyond correctly ­
notwithstanding Todorov's ( 1 973: 1 7) stricture that the icon is a 
synecdoche rather than a metaphor - assigning this, in his list of 
categories, to the icon . The iconic functions of language have 
been studied in some detail (e .g . ,  Jakobson 1 965, Valesio 1 969 , 
Wescott 1 97 1 ) .  

Despite the vast, ever multiplying, and by and large helpful liter­
ature advancing our understanding of the icon , several serious 
theoretical problems persist. Two among these - let us call them 
the issue of symmetry and the issue of regression - are worth at 
least a brief pause here ;  some others are discussed by Eco ( 1 972a: 
197-230, 1 972b) in a consistently interesting albei t  inconclusive 
way. 

Wallis ( 1 973: 482) , for one, following custom, asserts ex cathedra 
that therrelation of representation is nonsymmetrical : an iconic 
sign or an independent conventional sign represents its repre­
sentatum but not vice versaJNow let a snapshot of a reproduction 
of a famous painting - say, La Gioconda - be an iconic sign , or 
image, for the copy, which thus becomes the denotatum (or 
representatum) ,  but which is itself an iconic sign for the original 
portrait hanging at the Louvre , i ts denotatum; but this painting, 
too ,  is an iconic sign for Leonardo 's model , the lady known as 
Mona Lisa, its denotatum . In this diachronic sequence,  Mona Lisa 
came first, her portrait next, then its reproduction , and finally a 
photograph of that. Note ,  however, that there is nothing in defini­
tions of iconicity requiring the imposition of any kind of chrono­
logical priority: Peirce's  definition speaks of ' a  mere community in 
some quality, ' and the one proposed at the start of this section only 
of 'a topological similarity, ' both qualities which would apply back­
wards just as well as forwards. Is i t  merely an unmotivated conven-



52 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

tion to assign a progressive temporal sequence to the relation 
between signifier and signified? The difficulty can perhaps be 
driven home by way of the following: suppose a renowned contem­
porary personage , such as the pope, is known to me - as he is to 
most Catholics - only through his photograph,  or some other pic­
torial representation, but that, one day, I get to see him in the flesh ; 
on that occassion ,  the living pope would become for me the ' iconic 
sign ' for his long-familiar image , i ts photographic or lithographic 
denotatum. This problem is not unfamiliar to ethologists either. 
Thus Lorenz (Introduction to Wickler 1968: xi ) alluded to this in 
his remark that the 'form of the horse ' s  hoof is just as much an 
image of the steppe it treads as the impression it leaves is an image 
of the hoof. '  If this attribute of reflexivity can be shown to be an 
indispensable characteristic property of icons, then surely time's 
arrow must be incorporated in revisions of extant definitions. 

As for the vertiginous problem of regression,  let it be illustrated 
by the following: an infant daughter can be said to be an iconic 
sign for her mother if there is a topological similarity between her, 
as signifier, and her mother, i ts denotatum; however, the little girl 
can likewise , though doubtless to a lesser degree,  stand as an iconic 
sign for her father, every one of her siblings, all of her kinfolk, and, 
further still , all mammals,  all vertebrates, and so forth ,  and so on , 
in unending retrogression to ever more generalized denotata. 

There are many instances of iconicity in animal discourse 
(Sebeok 1 968: 6 1 4ff. ) , involving virtually all of the available chan­
nels - chemical , auditory, or visual . The iconic function of a chem­
ical sign is well  illustrated by the alarm substance of the ant 
Pogonomyrmex badius : if the danger to the colony is momentary, the 
signal - a quantum of released pheromone - quickly fades and 
leaves the bulk of the colony undisturbed; conversely, if it persists ,  
the substance spreads, involving an ever-increasing number of 
workers. The sign is iconic inasmuch as it varies in analogous pro­
portion to the waxing or waning of the danger stimuli (Sebeok 
1972a: 95f. ) . 

The behaviour of certain vespine audio-mimics illustrates the 
iconic function of an auditory sign.  Thus the fly Spilomyia hamifera 
Lw. displays a wing-beat rate of 1 47 strokes per second while hov-



Six Species of Signs 53 

ering near the wasp Dolichovespula arenaria F. (which it closely 
resembles in colour pattern) . Since this wasp flies with 1 250 wing 
strokes per second ,  the two flight  sounds are presumed to be indis­
tinguishable to predators, and fly-catching birds are thus deceived 
(Sebeok 1 972a: 86f. ) . 

Finally, an elegant ( if some times disputed) example of a com­
plex piece of behaviour that evolved ,  as it were, to function as a 
visual iconic sign is graphically described by Kloft ( 1 959) : the hind 
end of an aphid's abdomen,  and the kicking of i ts hind legs,  consti­
tute , for an ant worker, a compound sign vehicle, signifying the 
head of another ant together with its antennal movement. In other 

I words, the ant is alleged to identifY likeness ( the near end of the 
aphid) with i ts denotatum ( the front end of an ant) and act on this 
information , that is, treat the aphid in the manner of an effigy 
(a subspecies of icon) . 

Index 

A s.i.g:n is said to be indexic insofar as i ts signifier is contiguous with 
its signified, or is a sample of it. The term contiguous is not to be 
interpreted literally in this definition as necessarily meaning 
'adjoining' or ' adjacent ' :  thus Polaris may be considered an index 
of the north celestial pole to any earthling, in spite of the immense 
distances involved.  Rather, continuity should be thought of in clas­
sical juxtaposition to the key principle in the definition of the icon, 

I to wit, similarity. 'Contiguous' was chosen because of i ts pervasive 
use , when paired with ' similar, '  in many fields of intellectual 

I endeavour, ranging from homeopathic versus contagious magic to 
poetics and rhetoric ( system vs text, metaphor vs metonym ) , Gestalt 

I psychology (factor of similarity vs factor of proximity [Wertheimer 
1 923: 304-1 1 ] ) ,  neurology (hypothesis of the polar types of apha­
sia by Jakobson and Luria) , and,  of course , linguistics in the Saus­

I surean tradition (paradigmatic axis vs syntagmatic axis, opposition 
vs contrast) , etc .  

Peirce 's notion of the index was at once novel and fruitful , as 
Wells ( 1 967) has rightly emphasized. I-J.is indexical signs have 
received close study by some of the most prominent philosophers 



54 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

of our time,  whether they tagged them egocentric particulars 
(Russell 1 940) , token-reflexive words (Reichenbach 1 948) , indexi­
cal expressions (Bar-Hillel 1 954) , or something else (Gale 1 967) . 
At the same time ,  Peirce 's ideas have informed the views of some 
linguists ,  to the effect that grammatical theory 'must take into 
its scope . . .  a theory of conversation , and [ that] certain under­
standings about deixis and pronominal reference make up part 
of that theory' (Fillmore 1 972 :  275) . Deixis is a well-known phe­
nomenon to linguists (Frei 1 944, Bursill-Hill 1 963) , notably in 
the guise of the ' shifter' - a mot juste coined by Jespersen in 
1 922 ( 1 964) , whose idea was extended, among others, by Sturt­
evant ( 1 947:  1 35f. ) , Jakobson ( 1 963) , and especially Fillmore 
( 1 973) in his admirable series of papers devoted to the spatial , 
temporal , discourse-oriented,  and social deictic anchoring of ut­
terances in  ' the  real world . '  

I n  one of his most memorable examples, Peirce recalls that the 
footprint Robinson Crusoe found in the sand was an index to him 
of some creature . In like fashion, a vast map of such records is 
printed overnight by animals of all sorts, all over the countryside ,  
leaving tracks and traces ' of immense variety, often of wonderful 
clarity. ' These ' s tories written in footprint code' compel ' country­
side detection '  and have been beautifully deciphered by such 
experienced field naturalists as Ennion and Tinbergen ( 1 967: 5 ) ; 
their meticulous track photographs and prints depict an astonish­
ing array of indexical signs in the most literal and immediate 
sense . 

The poin ted lip gesture in use among the Cuna Indians of Pan­
ama, as analysed by Sherzer ( 1 973) , provides a neat instance of cul­
tural integration into a single unified arrangement of a verbal 
index with a non-verbal index. His description also shows that, 
whereas the index constitutes a marked category in opposition to 
the sign , the Cuna lip work stays unmarked in its focal indexical 
function in opposition to those accretive forms that have acquired 
peripheral meanings.  

A small family of cerophagous picarian birds, a common species 
of which bears the scientific name Indicator indicator ( nomen est 
omen ?) , are the celebrated honey-guides. These birds have devel-



Six Species of Signs 55 

oped a remarkable symbiotic relationship with certain mammals -
ratels, baboons, and humans - by employment of a purely indexi­
cal link: they guide their symbionts to the vicinity of wild bees' 
nests. The leading is preponderantly delophonic, but delotropic 
elements enter into it  too : a would-be guiding bird will come to , 
say, a person and chatter until followed, but keep out of sight of 
the pursuer most of the time.  Although its dipping flight is con­
spicuous, with the bird 's white tail feathers widely spread, the 
honey guide ' indicates' mainly by means of a repetitive series of 
chirring notes that subside only when i t  sees or hears flying, buzz­
ing bees, whose nests ,  of course , are the target (Friedmann 1 955) . 

The theory of honey-bee (APis mellifera) exploitation of food 
sources has been described (Frisch 1 967) and pondered by many 
scientists, including semioticians and linguists. It is common 
knowledge that if the food source is farther away than a hundred 
metres,  the tail-wagging dance conveys, among other bits of infor­
mation ,  the direction of the goal , the sun being used as the refer­
ence point. Now if the bee dances on a horizontal surface ,  ' the 
direction of a waggling run points directly to the goal , '  that is to 
say, the sign is indexical ( the rhythm ' indicates' the distance in 
analog fashion:  the farther away the goal, the fewer cycles of the 
dance in a given time) . If, however, the dance takes place on a ver­
tical comb surface - as is the case , as a rule ,  in the dark hive - then 
' the dancer transposes the solar angle into the gravitational angle '  
( if  the run is pointed upward, this indicates that the food source 
lies in the direction of the sun , if downwards, opposite the sun ,  if 
60° left of straigh t up, 60° to the left of the sun ,  and so forth) 
(Frisch 1 967: 230f.) . If a vertical honeycomb is involved,  in other 
words, when an angle with respect to gravity is used as the orienta­
tion cue , the sign ceases to be an index: its symbolic aspect now 
ranks predominant. 

Symbol 

A sign without either similarity or contiguity, but only with a con­
ventional link between its signifier and its denotata, and with an 
intentional class for its designatum, is called a symbol. The feature 



56 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

'conventional link' - Peirce's  ' imputed character '  - is introduced, 
of course , to distinguish the symbol from both the icon and the 
index, while the feature ' intension ' is required to distinguish it 
from the name.  The logical opposition between intension (some­
times also called ' objective intension , '  and often ' comprehension ' )  
and extension has been drawn i n  a bewildering number and vari­
ety of ways - from 530 B.C .  to the present  (Carnap 1 956: 1 8 ,  
Stanosz 1 970) . For the present purposes, an intensionally defined 
class is one defined by the use of a propositional function; the 
denotata of the designation are defined in terms of properties 
shared by, and only by, all the members of that class, whether these 
properties are known or not (Reichenbach 1 948: 1 93) . In the ter­
minology of Lewis ( 1 946: 39) , intension refers to ' the conjunction 
of all terms each of which must be applicable to anything to which 
the given term would be applicable . '  

Admittedly, ' symbol ' i s  the most abused term of those under 
consideration here .  In consequence, it has either tended to be gro­
tesquely overburdened, or, on the contrary, reduced to more gen­
eral kinds of behavioural phenomena, or even to absurd nullity. A 
few brief illustrative instances of both tendencies will suffice here ;  
they are merely intended to underline the need for further con­
ceptual clarification . 

An unjustifiably excessive generalization and overly broad appli­
cation of the concept of symbolic forms mark the writings of many 
of Ernst Cassirer's epigones or of those indirectly influenced by his 
philosophy (Sebeok 1 973a: 1 89) . In cultural anthropology, a case 
in point is Leslie White ( 1 940: 454) , who once wrote: ' Human 
behavior is symbolic behavior; symbolic behavior is human behav­
ior. The symbol is the universe of humanity . . .  the key to this world 
and the means of participation in it is - the symbol. ' This hyper­
bole was reflected, essentially, in the viewpoint espoused by the 
founder of the International Society for the Study of Symbols and 
so advocated by him (Kahn 1969) . 

According to the psychologist Kantor ( 1 936: 63) , ' the term sym­
bol is made to do duty for everything the psychologist calls a stimu­
Ius. ' One may well ask, how widespread is the redundancy among 
cognitive scien tists? 



Six Species of Signs 57 

Although the term is included in Cherry's ( 1 966: 309 ) otherwise 
helpful glossary, i t  is immediately followed by this odd disclaimer: 
'We avoid the term symbol as far as possible in this book . '  As a mat­
ter of fact, linguists have always tended to shy away from the term 
with only a few exceptions (e .g . ,  Landar 1 966, Chao 1 968) . 

A number of important symbol subspecies - whose semiotic 
import, however, has seldom been properly analysed - are in more 
or less common use, at least in contemporary English . Such subor­
dinate terms, with increasing intension ,  include:  allegory, badge, 
brand, device ( in heraldry) , emblem, insignia, mark, and stigma (when 
not embodied as a symptom, as in the expression 'venous stig­
mata, '  suggesting alcoholic excess) (Coffman 1 963:  1-2 ) . 

Let us take a brief look at only one of these - the emblem. It is 
clear, from the outset, that i ts distribution must be narrower than 
that of its immediate superordinate : thus, one can say that the 
hammer and sickle was either the symbol or the emblem of the 
Communist Party, or the Eiffel Tower of Paris, but one cannot say 
that H20 is a chemical emblem. 

Following a proposal put forward by David Efron in 1 941  
( 1 972) , Ekman and Friesen ( 1 969: 59 )  reintroduced and sharp­
ened the notion of the emblem: 

Emblems differ from most other nonverbal behaviors primarily in their 
usage , and in particular in their relationship to verbal behavior, aware­
ness and intentionality. Emblems are those nonverbal acts which have a 
direct verbal translation , or dictionary definition , usually consisting of a 

I word or two, or perhaps a phrase . This verbal definition or translation of 
the emblem is well known by all members of a group, class, or culture . . .  
People are almost always aware of  their use of  emblems; that is, they know 
when they are using an emblem, can repeat it if asked to do so, and will 
take communicational responsibility for it. 

They have in mind here the nonverbal emblems only, and it is, 
indeed,  the case that an emblem is  most often conceived of as a 
highly formalized symbol in the visual modality. However, this 
need not always be so . Thus Levi-Strauss has suggested (in a per-

I sonal communication) that recited genealogies of notable individ-



58 Signs:  An Introduction to Semiotics 

uals, say, of Mrican ancestor chiefs, may well be regarded as being 
emblematic; such verbal acts could readily be accommodated 
within the scope of the foregoing formulation ,  as perhaps could 
Hollander's ( 1 959) decidedly more idiosyncratic usage in connec­
tion with metrics. 

I t  should be obvious, even from these sparse paragraphs, that the 
Wortfeld of the symbol is a very complex one indeed, and that the 
emblem and its congeners must await a fully correct lexicographic 
domain of the immediately dominant term, symbol, as a whole. 

Symbols are often asserted to be the exclusive property of human 
beings, but the capacity of organisms to form intentional class con­
cepts obtains far down in phylogenesis Qacob 1 974: 3 1 9 ) , and the 
ability for constructing universals from particulars was provided 
with a solid mathematical-neurological rationalization by Pitts and 
McCulloch ( 1 947, see Arbib 1971 ) .  According to both the defini­
tion of the symbol offered here and the more common Aristotelian 
definitions resting on the doctrine of arbitrariness that were pro­
moted in linguistics, especially by Whitney and Saussure (Engler 
1 962, Coseriu 1 967) , animals undoubtedly do have symbols. I have 
previously commented on the arbitrariness of tail work in dogs, cats, 
and horses (Haldane 1 955: 387, Sebeok 1 973a: 1 96) , a set of exam­
ples that could easily be amplified:  thus a fearful rhesus monkey car­
ries  its tail stiffly out behind, whereas, in baboons, fear is conveyed 
by a vertical tail .  However, the converse is not necessarily true :  ' a  
mother o f  a young infant [baboon] may hold her tail vertical not in 
fear but to help her infant balance on her back; and the tail may also 
be held vertical while i ts owner is being groomed in the tail region ' 
(Rowell 1 9 72 :  87) . According to Altmann ( 1 967: 376) , with 'few 
exceptions, the semantic social signals that have been studied in pri­
mates so far are arbitrary representations' ; and,  more , generally, 
according to Bronowski ( 1 967: 376) , it 'might be thought that 
because only human beings think with arbitrary symbols, they are 
also alone in speaking with them.  But once again, this is not so' ( see 
also Malson 1 973 and Lurker 1 968: 4) . 

For one more example of a symbol in animal behaviour, I turn 
to the insects of the carnivorous family Empididae. In a species of 



Six Species of Signs 59 

dipterans of this family, the male offers the female an empty bal­
loon prior to copulation.  The evolutionary origin, that is, the 
increasing ritualization (Huxley 1 966) , of this seemingly bizarre 
gesture has been unravelled step by step by biologists, but this story 
is irrelevant in synchronic perspective: the fact is that the gift of an 
empty balloon is a wholly arbitrary sign , the transfer of which sim­
ply reduces the probability that the male himself will fall prey to his 
female partner. 

Name 

A sign which has an extensional class for its designatum is called a 
name.  In accordance with this definition, individuals denoted by 
a proper name such as Veronica have no common property attrib­
uted to them save the fact  that they all answer to 'Veronica. ' An 
extensional definition of a class is one that is given 'by listing the 
names of the members, or by pointing to every member succes­
sively' (Reichenbach 1 948: 1 93) ; or, as Kecskemeti ( 1 952 :  1 30) put 
it, ' considered in terms of its intension . . .  a name is simply a blank, 
unless and until a description referring to the same object is sup­
plied, ' say, 'Veronica with the handkerchief, '  Saint Veronica, or the 
like ( see also S0renson 1 963) . 

When the signification of a sign permits only one denotatum it is 
said to be singular. Singular signs, including proper names, belong 
to a mode of signifying that Morris ( 1 97 1 : 76f. ) has labelled 
namors, 'which are language symbols. ' Namors are members of the 
same family of signs, called ' identifiors , '  to which two other sub­
categories belong: indicators, the non-linguistic pendant to nam­
ors; and descriptors, ' identifiors which describe a location . '  In the 
parlance of Husserl ( 1 970: 34 1 £. ) , the name of a person is also 
normally univocal ( eindeutig) although it may, by chance,  be pluriv­
ocal ( mehrdeutig) . Human individuals are identified by verbally 
attestable namors,  say, a personal name or (in the Uriited States 
since 1 935) a unique social security registration number; and by 
a host of non-verbal indicators, ' the means by which a person, 
or dead body, may be definitely recognized,  even in cases where 



60 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

the person purposely attempts to mislead ' (Wilder and Wentworth 
1 9 1 8: 5) . 

It is well known that all animals broadcast a steady stream of 
' indentifiors , '  that is, displays identifYing their source in one or 
more ways: as to species, reproductive status, location in space or 
time,  rank in a social hierarchy, momentary mood, and the like 
(Sebeok 1 972a: 1 30) . In addition, the best organized societies of 
vertebrates can be distinguished by a single trait so overriding in its 
consequences that the other characteristics seem to flow from it. 
Wilson ( 1 97 1 : 402) remarks, as he draws a pivotal distinction 
between the impersonal societies formed by the insects ,  on the one 
hand, and the ' personal ' societies found in birds and mammals on 
the other: this attribute is the recognition of individual identity, a 
feature of relatively small circles with long-term socialization in the 
young that presupposes play and has as its corollary a high degree 
of mutual cooperation among adults. Each member of such a soci­
ety 'bears some particular relationship to every other member' and 
thereby comes to be known to all others as unique . Coupled to 
efforts to establish and maintain the requisite network of multifari­
ous 'personal ' bonds is the development of an intimate form of 
communication ,  which necessarily involves the use of appropriate 
supportive signs: thus the notion of 'uniqueness' implies the mani­
festation of indicators, or, in Goffman 's ( 1 963: 56) terminology, 
' identity pegs. ' 

The literature on vertebrate communication takes it for granted 
- at least ex hypothesi - that indicators ( i .e . ,  their own names) are 
universally incorporated into all messages of birds and mammals 
(Smith 1 969a, 1969b) . Thorpe.  ( 1 967) has shown that when a part­
ner is absent, the remaining bird will use the sounds normally 
reserved for the partner, with the result that the said partner will 
return as quickly as possible as if called by name.  Specific examples 
can be multiplied from a variety of vertebrates,  including canines 
and felines, primates (Lawick-Goodall 1 968, Rowell 1 972) , and 
marine mammals. Individual whale click trains are even referred 
to as ' signatures'  (Backus and Schevill 1 966) , apparently by anal­
ogy with the so-called ' signature-tunes' of birds.

On the Being, Behaving, and Becoming of Signs 

This chapter has dealt with a half dozen possible relationships that 
are empirically found to prevail between the signifier and the signi­
fied components of signs, and certain problems attendant to the 
definitions offered, in particular as these may have a bearing on 
their classification. The discussion has been concerned with the 
being of a sign , or its structure , that is, i ts enduring status in a syn­
chronic sense; the focus of the inquiry fell within the realm of sig­
nification. A structural definition of the sign is analytic, intrinsic, 
and static; it utilizes types of associations inherent, in fact or virtu­
ally, in the architecture of the sign itself. 

It should be supplemented, however, with a searching examina­
tion of the sign 's behaving, or its function ,  a repetitive perturbation 
along a secular trend. A functional definition of the sign is prag­
matic, extrinsic, but dynamic; it is based upon variations at differ­
ent nodal points of an expanded model of the communicative 
process, as depicted, for instance by a Morley triangle (Sebeok 

, 1972a: 1 4) .  Wells ( 1 967: 1 03)  has aptly stated that ' semiotics has 
, two groups of affinities. It is concerned, on the one hand, with 

communication ,  and,  on the other, with meaning. ' 
The question of becoming, or history, representing cumulative 

changes in the longitudinal time section,  introduces manifold 
diachronic considerations. These are of two rather different sorts :  
those having to do with the evolution of signs in phylogeny, in a 
word, their ritualization (Huxley 1 966) ; and those having to do 
with their elaboration in ontogeny. Study of the former requires 
the collaboration of ethology with semiotics; research of the latter 
belongs to the advancing field of psycholinguistics. 

In sum, although semiotics is most commonly regarded as a 
branch of the communication disciplines, the criteria that must be 
integrated when working toward even a reasonably holistic com­
prehension of signs derive from studies of both signification and 
communication ( noumena and phenomena) , and they must also be

62 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

Applying the Law of Inverse Variation 

The terms sign, symbol, emblem, and insignia are here arranged in 
the order of their subordination, each term to the left being a 
genus of its subclass to the right, and each term to the right being 
a species of its genus to the left. Thus the denotation of these 
terms decreases :  for example, the extension of ' symbol ' includes 
the extension of ' emblem, '  but not conversely. As well ,  the conven­
tional intension of each term increases :  the intension of 'emblem' 
includes the intension of ' symbol . '  Sometimes, however, variation 
in the intension is accompanied by no change in the extension : 
thus, in the sequence ' sign , '  ' symbol, '  ' omen, '  ' augury, '  and ' por­
tent'  the extension of the last pair of terms is, within the semiotic 
universe of discourse , materially the same. This implies that if a 
series of semiotic categories is arranged in order of their increas­
ing intension , the denotation of the terms will either diminish or 
will remain the same. 

A Lexical Domain 

Besides the six species of signs described here ,  allusion has been 
made to a wide variety of others, including allegory, badge, brand, 
descriptor, device, diagram, display, effigy, emblem, identifior, 
identity peg, image indicator, insignia, mark, metaphor, namor, sig­
nature, stigma, and syndrome. No doubt, these and a high number 
of cognate terms - especially those introduced by Peirce (2 :254-
63) and Morris ( 1 971 :  20-3) - would need a separate treatment, 
despite Revzina's ( 1 972: 231 ) remark that it would evidently be 
more natural to treat the definitions of signs ' as an attempt at a lex­
icographical interpretation of corresponding language concepts . ' 

The Ubiquity of Signs 

As the English zoologist RJ. Pumphrey pointed out, there are two 
schools of thought with regard to language development ( see 
Sebeok 1 972a: 88) . One claims that human speech is different in 
material particulars from that of other animals, but that the two 



Six Species of Signs 63 

are tied by evolution (continuity theory) . The other claims that 
speech is a specifically human attribute , a function de novo, differ­
ent in kind from anything of which o ther animals are capable (dis­
continuity theory) . Without supporting one or the other, one 
thing must, above all  else,  be emphasized: it is essential to adopt a 
research strategy that compares human and animal communica­
tion systems in order to get a meaningful glimpse into the nature 
and ubiquity of semiosis.

Symptom Signs 

In  the previous chapter it was pointed out that the symptom was a 
rudimentary sign connected intrinsically with bodily processes .  
Symptoms were the first signs examined by the medical practitio­
ners of the ancient world; and their study led to the foundation of 
semiotics as a branch of medical science. In this chapter, I will look 
more closely at symptom signs.  

Ullmann ( 1 95 1 : 1 61 )  distinguished among four juxtaposed 
branches of word study: ' ( 1 )  the science of names ( lexicology if 
synchronistic,  etymology if diachronistic) ; (2) the science of mean­
ings (semantics) ; (3 )  the science of designations (onomasiology) ; 
(4)  the science of concepts (Begriffslehre) . '  Although the distinction 
between designation and meaning is far from consistently drawn 
or pellucid, I take it that this alterity depends on whether one 's 
starting point is the name, th e lexeme, or, more generally, the sign; or 
whether it is the concept or, more generally, the object, that is, the 
constellation of properties and relations the sign stands for. If the 
former, the analysis should yield a semiotic network responsive to 
the question, What does a given sign signify in  contrast and opposi­
tion to any other sign within the same system of signs? If the latter, 
the analysis should reveal the sign by which a given entity is desig­
nated within a certain semiotic system.  According to Ullmann, the 
second inquiry is the corne rstone of the distinction, but I believe 
that the two questions are indissolubly complementary. In any 
case , the whole enterprise critically hinges upon how the investiga­
tor parses the sign/object ( aliquid/ aliquo) antithesis, and what the 
conjunctive stands for, in the judgment of the investigator, entails. 



66 Signs:  An Introduction to Semiotics 

The probe becomes at once more intricate , but also more in­
triguing, when the lexical field ( Bedeutungsfeld? Sinnfeld? Wortfeld?)  
being explored happens to  be  reflexive , that i s ,  self-searching. 
Such is the case of symptom signs.  An examination of this sign 
type may begin in the inner realm of the lexicon,  if viewed as a 
name, or in the outer realm of clinical experience, if viewed as 
sense. 

The Meaning of Symptom 

One may properly inquire : what does the lexeme symptom mean in 
a certain language ; or what does the same lexeme designate, that 
is, reveal as a diagnostic intimation,  with respect to , say, an actual 
quality of ' diseasehood' (Fabrega 1 974: 1 23)  that Crookshank ( in 
Ogden and Richards 1 923:  343) foresightedly portrayed as ' a  mys­
terious substantia that has biological properties and produces 
symptoms' ?  In the end, the results of such dichotomous inquiries 
amalgamate in a common dialectical synthesis. For the present 
purposes, the language chosen is American English . However, the 
semantic field of ' medical discourse, '  which is typically nested 
within wider sets of concentric frames (Labov and Fanshel 1 977: 
36f. ) , is here assumed to be,  mutatis mutandis, very similar to that in 
every other speech community committed to the paradigm of 
medical theory and practice ' in the context of the great tradition ' 
(Miller 1 978: 1 84) of thinking marked by a continuity that links 
modern clinicians with the idea of insomnia launched by the bril­
liant Alcmaeon of Croton during the first half of the fifth century 
B .C .  This heritage was further consolidated by Hippocrates - argu­
ably considered,  at one and the same time ,  the 'father of medicine ' 
(Heidel 1 941  : xiii ) , and the 'father and master of semiotics' (Klein­
paul 1 972: 1 03)  - then Plato, Aristotle ,  and the Alexandrian physi­
cians of the fourth century B .C .  Equally perceptive studies of 
symptom have , in fact, cropped up in the semiotic literature (e .g. , 
Baer 1 982) and in the medical literature (e .g. ,  Prodi 1 98 1 ) ,  under­
taken by savants who mutually know their way around the other 
field as well as their own ( see also Staiano 1 979) . One should, how­
ever, continue to be ever mindful of the admonition of Mounin 



Symptom Signs 67 

( 1 981 ) against a mechanical application of semiotic (especially lin­
guistic) concepts to medicine ( especially psychiatry) . 

Symptom always appears in conjunction with sign, but the precise 
nature of the vinculum is far from obvious (as in MacBryde and 
Blacklow 1 970 or Chamberlain and Ogilvie 1 974) . The basic semi­
osic facts were perspicuously depicted by Ogden and Richards 
( 1 923: 2 1 ) :  

Ifwe stand in the neighbourhood of a crossroad and observe a pedestrian 
confronted by a notice To Grandchester displayed on a post, we commonly 
distinguish three important factors in the situation. There is, we are sure, 
( 1 )  a Sign which (2 )  refers to a Place and (3 )  is being inter-preted by a 
person. All situations in which Signs are considered are similar to this. 
A doctor noting that his patient has a temperature and so forth is said to 
diagnose his disease as influenza. If we talk like this we do not make it 
clear that signs are here also involved. Even when we speak of symptoms 
we often do not think of these as closely related to other groups of signs. 
But if we say that the doctor interprets the tern-perature , e tc .  as a Sign of 
influenza, we are at any rate on the way to an inquiry as to whether there 
is anything in common between the manner in which the pedestrian 
treated the object at the crossroad and that in which the doctor treated 
his thermometer and the flushed countenance. 

The relation of sign to symptom involves either coordination or 
subordination. If the distinction is between coordinates, what mat­
ters is not their inherent meaning but the mere fact of the binary 
opposition between the paired c£!.tegories. This was nicely brought 
to the fore in a report of an investigation of the symptom 'fatigue' 
by two physicians, Shands and Finesinger (Shands 1 970: 52) : 

The close study of . . .  patients made it imperative to differentiate carefully 
between 'fatigue, '  a feeling, and ' impairment, '  an observable decrement 
in performance following protracted effort. The distinction comes to be 
that between a symptom and a sign. The symptom is felt, the sign observed 
by Some other person . These two terms cover the broad field of semio­
tics; they are often confused, and the terms interchanged without 
warning. 



68 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

This passage underscores the importance of separating the ' pri­
vate world'  of introspection reported by the description of the 
symptoms on the part of the patient from the public world of signs 
reported by the description of behaviour on the part of the physi­
cian . As pointed out elsewhere: ' I t  is a peculiarity of symptoms that 
their denotata are generally different from the addresser, i .e .  the 
patient ( "subjective symptoms , "  confusingly called by many medi­
cal practitioners "signs")  and the addressee ,  i .e .  the examining 
physician ( "objective symptoms," or simply "symptoms") ' (Sebeok 
1 976: 1 8 1 ) .  Note that only a single observer - to wit, oneself - can 
relate symptomatic events,  whereas an indefinite number of 
observers - including oneself - can observe signs. Accordingly, 
within this framework the fact of privacy looms as a criterial distinc­
tive feature that demarcates any symptom from any sign (Sebeok 
1 979) . Symptoms could thus be read as recondite communiques 
about an individual 's  inner world, an interpretation that some­
times acquires that status of an elaborate occult metaphor. For 
instance, the eating disorder anorexia nervosa would appear to be 
reasonably decodable as 'I am starving (emotionally) to death . '  Its 
symptoms are believed to result from disturbed family relation­
ships and interpersonal difficulties (Liebman, Minuchin, and 
Baker 1 974a, 1 9 74b) . One palpable sign of this ailment  is, of 
course, weight phobia, measurable as a decrement in the patient 's  
mass. 

The crucial distinction between fatigue and impairment is simi­
lar to that between anxiety as a felt symptom and behavioural 
disintegration often exhibited in states of panic. The latter is a sign , 
not a symptom (Shands 1 970) . The dissemblance exemplified here 
is obviously related to Uexkiill 's  ( 1 982: 209) notion, maintained 
both in the life and the sign sciences of 'inside ' and 'outside . '  I take 
the pivotal implication of this to be as follows: ' Something observed 
(== outside) stands for something that is (hypothetically) noticed by 
the observed subjects (== inside) . Or something within the observ­
ing system stands for something within the observed system' 
(Uexkiill 1 982: 209) . For any communication , this complemen tary 
relationship is obligatory, because the organism and its Umwelt 
together constitute a system.  The shift from physiological process 



Symptom Signs 69 

to semiosis is a consequence of the fact that the observer assumes a 
hypothetical stance within the observed system ( Bedeutungsertei­
lung-Bedeutungsverwertung) . 

For symptom, there exists an array of both stricter and looser syn­
onyms. Among the former, which appear to be more or less com­
monly employed, Elstein et  al. ( 1 978: 279) solely and extensively 
use cue. Although they do so without a definition, their import is 
made quite clear from passages such as ' cues were interpreted by 
physicians as tending to confirm or discQnfirm a hypothesis, or as 
noncontributory. ' Fabrega ( 1 974: 1 26) seems to prefer indicator, 
but he uses this commutably for either symptom or sign; and when 

I he remarks that ' all indicators may be needed in order to make 
I judgments about disease , '  he surely refers to both categories to­

gether. The word clue, however, is a looser synonym for symptom: 
generally speaking, whereas symptom is used in medical discourse , 
clue is found in the detective sphere (Sebeok 1 98 1 a, Eco and 
Sebeok 1 983) . 

In the minimalist coupling, sign and symptom are equipollent; 
both are unmarked vis-a.-vis one another (Waugh 1 982) . Some­
times, however, symptom encompasses both ' the objective sign and 
the subjective sign ' (Staiano 1 982: 332) . In another tradition, symp­
tom is a mere phenomenon 'qui precisement n ' a  encore rien de 
semiologique, de semantique, ' or is considered falling ( e .g. , in the 
terminology of glossematics) in the area of content articulation , La 
substance du signifiant, an operationally designated figura that is 
elevated to full semiotic status only through the organizing con­
sciousness of the physician , achieved through the mediation of 
language (Barthes 1 972 :  38f. ) . However, still other radically differ­
ent sorts of arrangements occur in the literature . In Buhler's 
organon model (see Sebeok 1 981  b) , symptom constitutes but one of 
three 'variable moments '  capable of rising ' in three different ways 
to the rank of a sign. '  These include signal, symbol, as well as 
symptom. Buhler ( 1 934: 28) specifies further that the semantic rela-

, tion of the latter functions 'by reason of its dependence on the 
sender, whose interiority it expresses. ' He clearly subordinates this 

I trio of words under one and the same Oberbegriff Zeichen. It should 
also be noted that Buhler's first mention of symptom is immediately 



70 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

followed by a parenthetic set of presumed synonyms: Anzeichen, 
Indicium. Thus, in acknowledging the importance of the notion of 
privacy as an essential unmarked feature of symptom, Biihler also 
recognizes that, while it is coordinate with two other terms, it is 
also subordinate to the (unmarked) generic notion of sign, namely 
that kind of sign that Peirce earlier, but unbeknownst to Biihler, 
defined with much more exactitude as an index. 

The Peircean View 

Despite his extensive knowledge of medicine (Sebeok 1 981  a) , 
Peirce did not often discuss symptom (nor anywhere, in any fecund 
way, syndrome, diagnosis, prognosis, or the like ) . For him, a symptom, 
to begin with , was one kind of sign. In a very interesting passage , 
from the dictionary lemma ' Represent, ' he expands: ' to stand for, 
that is ,  to be in such a relation to another that for certain purposes 
it is treated by some mind as if it were that other. Thus, a spokes­
man ,  deputy, attorney, agent, vicar, diagram, symptom, counter, 
description , concept, premise , testimony, all represent  something 
else , in their several ways, to minds who consider them in that way' 
(Peirce 2 :273) . 

For Peirce , however, a symptom was never a distinct species of 
sign , but a mere subspecies, namely the index - or secondness of 
genuine degree ( in contrast to a demonstrative pronoun, exempli­
fYing secondness of a degenerative nature) - of one of his three 
canonical categories. But what kind of sign is this? Peirce (2 :304) 
gives an example that I would prefer to label a clue: 'Such for 
instance,  is a piece of mould with a bullet-hole in it as a sign of a 
shot; for without a shot there would have been no hole ; but there is 
a hole there , whether anybody has the sense to attribute it to a shot 
or not. ' The essential point  here is that the indexical character of 
the sign would not be voided if there were no interpretant, but 
only if its object was removed. An index is that kind of a sign that 
becomes such by virtue of being really ( i . e . ,  factually) connected 
with its object: ' such is a symptom of disease ' (Peirce 8 : 1 1 9 ) . All 
' symptoms of disease , '  furthermore , 'have no utterer, ' as is also the 
case with ' signs of the weather' (8 : 1 85) . We have an index, Peirce 



Symptom Signs 71  

prescribed in  1 885 , when there i s  ' a  direct dual relation of  the sign 
to its object independent of the mind using the sign . . .  Of this 

, nature are all natural signs and physical symptoms' ( 3 :361 ) .  
A further detail worth pointing out is that Peirce calls the ' occur­

rence of a symptom of a disease . . .  a legisign, a general type of a 
definite character, '  but ' the occurrence in a particular case is a sin­
sign '  (8 :335) , that is to say, a token .  A somewhat cryptic remark 
reinforces this: 'To a sign which gives reason to think that some­
thing is true, I prefer to give the name of a symbol; although the 
words token and symptom likewise recommend themselves. '  Staiano 
( 1 982: 331 ) is undoubtedly correct in remarking that ' the appear­
ance of a symptom in an individual is thus an indexical sinsign , 
while the symptom interpreted apart from its manifestation 
becomes an indexical legisign . '  

Symptoms, i n  Peirce 's  usage , are thus unwitting indexes, inter-
I pretable by their receivers without the actuality of any intentional 

sender. Jakobson ( 1 97 1 : 703) likewise includes symptoms within 
the scope of semiotics but cautions that 'we must consistently take 
into account the decisive difference between communication 
which implies a real or alleged addresser and information whose 
source cannot be viewed an addresser by the interpreter of the indi­
cations obtained. '  This remark glosses over the fact that symptoms 

, are promptings of the body crying out for an explanation - for the 
, construction,  by the self, of a coherent and intelligible pattern 

(which of course may or may not be accurate, for which see Polunin 
1977: 9 1 ) .  Pain comprises one such symptom that embodies a 
message compelling the central nervous system to influence both 
covert and overt behaviour to seek out signs of pain,  throughout 
phylogeny, ontogeny hie et ubique. Miller ( 1 978: 45-9) befittingly 
expands: 

From the instant when someone first recognizes his symptoms to the 
moment when he eventually complains about them, there is always an 
interval, longer or shorter as the case may be , when he argues with 
himself about whether i t  is worth making a complaint known to an 
expert . . .  At one time or another we have all been irked by aches and 

, pains. We have probably noticed alterations in weight, complexion and 



72 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

bodily function, changes in power, capability and will, unaccountable 
shifts of mood. But on the whole we treat these like changes in the 
weather. 

As pointed out in the previous chapter, Peirce (4 :35 1 ) once 
particularized the footprint Robinson Crusoe found in the sand to 
be an index ' that some creature was on his island ' ;  and indeed an 
index always performs as a sign the vectorial direction of which is 
toward the past, or, as Thorn ( 1 980: 1 94) put it, 'par reversion de la 

, 
causalite generatrice, which is the inverse of physical causality. 
Augustine's  class of signa naturali, defined - in contrast to signa 
data - by the relation of dependence between sign and the things 
signified (De Doctrina Christiana 2 . 1 .2) , besides its orthodox sense 
( such as a rash as a symptom of measles) , is also illustrated by foot­
prints left by an animal passed out of sight, and may thus be 
regarded as encompassing a portent, or in  the most general usage , 
evidence (for instance, as a southwesterly wind may both signify 
and bring rain;  i . e . ,  give rise to its significatum) .  Thus symptoms, 
in many respects, function like tracks - footprints, toothmarks, 
food pellets, droppings and urine, paths and runs, snapped twigs, 
lairs, the remains of meals, etc .  - throughout the animal world 
(Sebeok 1 976: 1 33)  and in hunting populations in which humans 
' learnt to sniff, to observe, to give meaning and context to the 
slightest trace ' (Ginzburg 1 983) . Tracks, including notably symp­
toms, operate like metonyms. This trope is also involved in pars pro 
toto, as extensively analysed by Bilz ( 1 940) . 

Symptoms and the Medical Origins of Semiotics 

I t  is, of course , Hippocrates who remains the emblematic ancestral 
figure of semiotics - that is, of semiology, in the narrow sense of 
symptomatology - although he ' took the notion of clue from the 
physicians who came before him ' (Eco 1 980: 277) . Baer ( 1 982: 1 8 ) 
alludes to a ' romantic symptomatology, '  which he postulates may 
have been ' the original one , '  carrying the field back ' to an era of 
mythical consciousness. ' Alcmaeon remarked,  in one of the scanty 
fragments of his book: 'As to things invisible and things mortal , the 



Symptom Signs 73 

gods have certainties; but, so far as men may infer . . .  men must 
proceed by clues' (Eco 1 980: 281 ) ,  namely 'provisional conjec­
ture. ' And what is to be the basis of such circumstantial inference? 

, Clearly, the concept that has always been central is symptom (Ginz­
burg 1 983) . 

While Alcmaeon is commonly regarded as the founder of empir­
, ical psychology, it was Hippocrates, a clinical teacher par excellence 

(Temkin 1 973) , who broke with archaic medical practice, in which 
the physician was typically preoccupied with the nature of the 

, disease ,  its causes and manifestations, and refocused directly upon 
the sick person and his/her complaints - in brief, upon the symptoms 
of disease (Neuburger 1 906: 1 96) . 

For Hippocrates and his followers symptoms were simply ' signifi­
cant phenomena' (Heidel 1 941 : 62) . Their consideration of symp­
toms as natural signs - those having the power to signify the same 
things in all times and places - was of the most comprehensive 
sort. A very early discussion of this type is found in Hippocrates' 
Prognostic xxv: 

One must clearly realize about sure signs, and about symptoms generally, 
that in every year and in every land bad signs indicate something bad, 
and good signs something favourable, since the symptoms described 
above prove to have the same significance in Lybia, in Delos, and in 
Scythia. So one must clearly realize that in the same districts it is not 
strange that one should be right in the vast majority of instances, if one 
learns them well and knows how to estimate and appreciate them 
properly. 

I have previously recalled an enduring example of his method, 
the detailed description of the famous facies hippocratica (Sebeok 
1979 :  6f. ) ; another example may be cited from Epidemics I (Heidel 
1941 :  1 29) : 

The following were circumstances attending the diseases, from which I 
formed my judgments, learning from the common nature of all and the 
particular nature of the individual, from the disease, the patient, the 
regimen prescribed and the prescriber - for these make a diagnosis 



74 Signs:  An Introduction to Semiotics 

more favourable or less; from the constitution, both as a whole and 
with respect to the parts, of the weather and of each region; from the 
customs, mode of life, practices and age of each patient; from talk, 
manner, silence, thoughts, sleep or absence of sleep, the nature and 
time of dreams, pluckings, scratchings, tears; from the exacerbations, 
stools, urine, sputa, vomit, the antecedents of consequents of each 
member in the succession of diseases,  and the absessions to a fatal issue 
or a crisis, sweat, rigor, chill, cough, sneezes, hiccoughs, breathing, 
belchings, flatulence, silent or noisy, hemorrhages, and hemorroids. 
From these things we must consider what their consequents also will be. 

In The Science oj Medicine Hippocrates also stated: 'What escapes 
our vision we must grasp by mental sight, and the physician , being 
unable to see the nature of the disease nor to be told of it, must 
have recourse to reasoning from the symptoms with which he is 
presented. ' The means by which a diagnosis may be reached ' con­
sist of observations on the quality of the voice, whether it be clear 
or hoarse , on respiratory rate , whether it  be quickened or slowed, 
and on the constitution of the various fluids which flow from the 
orifices of the body, taking into account their smell and colour, as 
well as their thinness or viscosity. By weighing up the significance 
of these various signs it is possible to deduce of what disease they 
are the result, what has happened in the past and to prognosti­
cate the future course of the malady' (Chadwick and Mann 1 950 : 
87-9) . 

However, it was Galen, whose one and only idol was Hippocrates 
and whose medicine remained (on the whole) Hippocratic, who 
attempted to provide prognostics, wherever feasible , with a scien­
tific underpinning, that is ,  to base his forecasts on actual observa­
tions. This he was able to do because he practised dissection and 
experiment: whereas Hippocrates studied disease as a naturalist, 
Galen ' dared to modifY nature as a scientist' (Majno 1 975: 396) .  
'Empirical method was first formulated in ancient medicine , '  as 
systematic and detailed expression in the Hippocratic corpus (De 
Lacy 1 941 : 1 2 1 ) ,  and became a part of the theory of signs for the 
Epicureans and Sceptics, in opposition to the Stoic rationalistic 
position.  Philodemus' fragmentary treatise (c .40 B .C . )  is by far the 



Symptom Signs 75 

most complete discussion of a thoroughgoing methodological 
I work uncovered (in the Herculaneum library) and extensively elu­

cidated to date . Galen , despite all of his Platonic training, was later 
'forced by his profession to be more empirical ' (Phillips 1 973:  
1 74) , even though this open-minded investigator, who continued 
to speak with the voice and authority of a scientist, did gradually 
turn into something of a dogmatic mystic (Sarton 1 954: 59) . He 
can therefore be regarded as a subtle founder of clinical semiotics 
as such (Neuburger 1 906: 385) . But he can also , very likely, be 
reckoned the first ' scientific ' semiotician . 

Galen 's  pen was as busy as his scalpel.  In the course of his 
exceptionally bulky writings, he classified semiotics as one of the 

I six principal branches of medicine, an ordering that had a spe­
cial importance for its 'effect on the later history of medicine'  
(Phillips 1 973: 1 72) . The strength of Galenism, as Temkin ( 1 973:  
1 79)  also emphasizes,  ' reposed in no small measure in having 
provided medical categories . . .  for relating the individual to 
health and disease , '  including ' semeiology ( the science of signs) . '  
Galen also divided the field into three enduring parts: in  the 
present, he asserted, its concern was inspection, or diagnosis, in 
the past cognition, or anamnesis (e tiology) , and,  in the future 
providence, or prognosis. His clinical procedure is depicted well by 
Sarton ( 1 954: 6) : 

""'hen a sick man came to consult him, Galen . . .  would first try to elicit his 
medical history and his manner of living; he would ask questions 
concerning the incidence of malaria and other ailments. Then the 
patient would be invited to tell the story of his new troubles, and the 
doctor would ask all the questions needed to elucidate them and would 
make the few examinations which were possible. 

Galen regarded everything 'unnatural ' occurring in the body as a 
symptom,  and an aggregation of symptoms as a syndrome. He was 
fully aware that symptoms and syndromes directly reflected clinical 
observation, but the formulation of a diagnosis required causal 
thinking (Siegel 1 973) . He was the master of foretelling the course 
of diseases (Neuburger 1 906: 383) . Although his prognostications 



76 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

rested essentially and loyally upon the Corpus Hippocratum, his own 
anatomical knowledge and exactitude of mind predisposed him to 
build up his prognoses from a cogent  diagnostic foundation. 

Interpreting Symptoms 

It would appear unreasonable to expect a finely attuned reciprocal 
conformation between internal states and ' reality, '  between an 
Innenwelt and the surrounding Umwelt, or more narrowly between 
symptoms and their interpretations as an outcome over time or 
evolutionary adaption - prodotto genetico, in Prodi 's  ( 1 981 : 973) suc­
cinct formulation - that benefits an organism by raising its 'fitting­
ness. ' But such does not reflect the state of the art of diagnosis. 
The probabilistic character of symptoms has long been realized, 
among others,  by the Port-Royal logicians (Sebeok 1 976: 1 25) . But 
their often vague,  uncertain disposition was clearly articulated by 
Thomas Sydenham, the seventeenth-century physician often called 
the 'English Hippocrates'  (Colby and McGuire 1 98 1 : 2 1 ) .  This 
much-admired doctor, held in such high regard by his brother of 
the profession ,  John Locke , was also known as the 'father of 
English medicine '  (Latham 1 848: xi) . Sydenham was noted for his 
scrupulous recognition of the priori ty  of direct observation . He 
demanded ' the sure and distinct perception of peculiar symp­
toms, '  shrewdly emphasizing that these symptoms ' referred less to 
the disease than to the doctor. '  He held that 'Nature , in the pro­
duction of disease , is uniform and consisten t; so much so, that for 
the same disease in different persons, the symptoms are for the 
most part the same; and the self-same phenomena that you would 
observe in the sickness of a Socrates you would observe in the sick­
ness of a simpleton '  (Latham 1 848: 1 4) .  This assertion of his was, 
of course, quite mistaken ,  although the medical-student jape 
referred to by Colby and McGuire ( 1 98 1 :  23) , ' that the trouble 
with psychiatry is that all psychiatric syndromes consist of the same 
signs and symptoms, '  appears to be equally exaggerated.  There 
are , to be sure , certain diagnostic difficulties inherent in the simi­
larities between the symptomatology of functional syndromes and 
of those of the organic maladies. The marginal, or supplementary,

symptoms of the former can , however, be assimilated according to 
I specific criteria, such as are set forth ,  for instance, by Uexkiill 

( 1 979) . 
This set of strictures leads me to a consideration of an aspect of 

symptom that is seldom mentioned in the literature , but that I 
have found both fascinating and, certainly for semiotics, of broad 
heuristic value . This has to do with anomalies, a problem that con­
cerned, in a philosophical context, especially Peirce . According to 
Humphries ( 1 968: 88) , a naturally anomalous state of affairs is 
such 'with respect to a set of statements which are at present  puta­
tively true , '  or, putting the matter in a more direct way, ' any fact or 
state of affairs which actually requires an explanation can be 

I shown to be in need of explanation on the basis of existing knowl­
edge ' ( 1 968: 89) . The enigmatic character of semiotic anomalies 
can be especially well illustrated by clinical examples, where few 

I existing models are capable of accounting for a multitude of 
facts. Medicine may, in truth , be one of the few disciplines lacking 

: an overarching theory, although local ,  non-linear, and hence 
. restricted and oversimple paradigms, such as the ' theory of infec­
, tious diseases , '  certainly do exist. 

Take as a first approach to the matter of anomalies the spiro­
chaete Treponema pallidum. This virus, in its tertiary phase, may 
manifest itself as ( 'cause ' )  aortitis in individual A, paretic neuro­
syphilis in individual B, or no disease at all in individual c. The lat­
ter, the patient with asymptomatic tertiary syphilis, can be said to 
have a disease without being ill. Note that a person may not only be 
diseased without being ill, but, conversely, be ill without having a 
specific identifiable disease . What can we say, in cases such as this, 
about the implicative nexus conjoining the ' proposition, ' that is, 

, the virus, with its consequent, expressed in some tangible manner 
or, on the contrary, mysteriously mantled? Are A, B, and C in com­
plementary distribution , and, if so , according to what principle -

I the consti tution of the patient, or some extrinsic factor (geo­
graphic, temporal , societal , age- or sex-related,  and so forth) , or a 
coalition of these? The influence of context, one suspects ,  may be 
paramount. This becomes overriding in the matter of hyperten­
sion - not a disease at all ,  but a sign of cardiovascular disorder 



78 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

(Paine and Sherman 1 970: 272) - which is realized in one and only 
one restricted frame:  within that of patient/physician interaction , 
assuming the aid of certain accessories, such as a sphygmoscope.  
Semiosis is ,  as it  were , called into existence solely under the cir­
cumstances mentioned; otherwise there are are no symptoms ( the 
asymptomatic, i . e . ,  so-called silent, hypertension lasts ,  on average , 
fifteen years) - there are no signs and there is, therefore , no deter­
minate - that is, diagnosable - object. 

Studies have shown that the majority of people who have gall­
stones go through life without palpable problems. The presence of 
these little pebbles of cholesterol that form in a sac that stores 
digestive juice can clearly be seen on X-rays: the shadows are the 
'objective signs , '  but most of them never cause pain, or any other 
symptom. They remain mute . They are , in other words, diagnosed 
only in the course of detailed check-ups, and thus require no surgi­
cal intervention.  

Sensory experiences, at times, lead to semiosic paradoxes, such as 
the following classic contravention. A hole in one of my teeth ,  which 
feels mammoth when I poke my tongue into it, is a subjective symp­
tom I may elect to complain about to my dentist. The dentist lets me 
inspect i t  in a mirror, and I am surprised by how trivially small the 
aperture - the objective sign - looks. The question is: which inter­
pretation is ' true , '  the one derived via the tactile modality or the 
one reported by the optical percept? The felt  image and the shape 
I see do not match . The dentist is, of course, unconcerned with the 
size of the hole , filling the cavity he/ she beholds. 

I t  is a common enough experience that the symptom (for rea­
sons ultimately having to do with the evolutionary design of the 
human central nervous system )  refers to a different part of the 
body than where the damage is actually situated.  'The pain of coro­
nary heart-disease , for example , is felt across the front of the chest, 
in the shoulders, arms and often in the neck and jaw. It  is not fel t  
where the heart i s  - slightly over the left' (Miller 1 978: 22) . Such a 
misreport is unbiological , in the sense that a lay reading could be 
fatal . An even more outlandish symptom is one for which the refer­
ent  is housed nowhere at all , dramatically illustrated by a phantom 
limb after amputation. Miller ( 1 978: 20) writes: 



Symptom Signs 79 

The phantom limb may seem to move - it may curl its toes, grip things, 
or feel its phantom nails sticking into its phantom palm. As time goes 
on , the phantom dwindles, but it does so in peculiar ways. The arm part 
may go, leaving a maddening piece of hand waggling invisibly from the 
edge of the real shoulder; the hand may enlarge itself to engulf the rest 
of the limb. 

What is involved here is an instance of subjective - as against 
objective - pain,  a distinction introduced by Friedrich J .K. Henle , 
the illustrious nineteenth-century German anatomist and physiolo­
gist, and generally perpetuated in classifications of pain ever since 
(e.g. , Behan 1 926) . Subjective pain is described as having 'no phys­
ical cause for existence ' ;  that is, there is no organic basis for its 
presence ( indeed, with respect to a limb unhinged, not even an 

, organ) : it results 'of impressions stored up in the memory centers, 
which are recalled by the proper associations aroused'  (Behan 
1 926: 74) , which is to say that the pain remains connected with a 
framework of signification dependent upon retrospective cogni­
zance. Referred pain and projection pain are closely allied; the lat­
ter is a term assigned to pain that is felt as being present either in a 
part that has no sensation ( as in locomotor ataxia) or in a part that 
because of amputation no longer exists .  

Certain symptoms - pain,  nausea, hunger, thirst, and the like -
, are private experiences, housed in no identifiable si te ,  but in an 

isolated annex that humans usually call ' the self. ' Symptoms such 
as these tend to be signified by paraphonetic means, such as 
groans or verbal signs, which may or may not be coupled with ges­
tures, ranging in intensity from frowns to writhings. An exceed­
ingly knotty problem, which can barely be alluded to here ,  arises 
from several meanings of ' self and how these relate to the matter 
of symptomatology. The biological definition hinges on the fact 
that the immune system does not respond overtly to its own self­
antigens; there are specific markers that modulate the system gen­
erating antigen-specific and idiotype-specific cell lines - in brief, 
activate the process of self-tolerance. Beyond the immunological 
self, there is also a ' semiotic self, ' which I have discussed elsewhere 
(Sebeok 1 979: 263-7) . 



80 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

Another diacritic category of symptoms deserves at least passing 
mention . These a linguist might be tempted to dub ' minus fea­
tures, ' or symptoms of abstraction . Here belong all the varieties of 
asemasia (Sebeok 1 976: 57, 1 979: 58) - agnosia, agraphia, alexia, 
amnesia, amusia, aphasia, apraxia, e tc . ,  as well as ' shortcomings' 
like blurred vision ,  hardness of hearing, numbness - in short, 
symptoms that indicate a deficit from some ideal standard of 
'normality. ' 

In any discussion of symptoms, it should be noted that even a 
syndrome or constellation of symptoms - say, of a gastronomical 
character (anorexia, indigestion, and haemorrhoids) - may not 
add up to any textbook case of disease labelling or terminology. 
Ensuing treatment may, accordingly, be denominated ' symptom­
atic , '  accompanied by the supplementary advice that the patient 
remain under continuing observation . In some circumstances, ' the 
syndrome might be ascribed to psychologic etiology' (Cheraskin 
and Ringsdorf 1 973:  37) . What this appears to mean is that the 
interpretation of symptoms is often a matter involving, over time , a 
spectrum of sometimes barely perceptible gradations, entailing a 
progressively multiplying number of still other symptoms. I t  is also 
worth remarking that, temporally, or for predictive purposes, 
symptoms generally precede signs, which is to say that the orderly 
unfolding of evidence may be termed prognostic. 

No one, at present, knows how afferent neuronal activity 
acquires meaning, beyond the strong suspicion that what is com­
monly called the ' external world, '  including the objects and events 
postulated as being contained in i t, is the brain's  formal structure 
( logos) . For all practical purposes, we are ignorant about how the 
central nervous system preserves any structure and assigns a mean­
ing to it, how this process relates to perception in general , and how 
i t  induces a response. Implicit in this set of queries is a plainly lin­
ear model: for example, that fear or joy 'causes '  increased heart 
rate . Not only does such a model seem to me far too simplistic,  but 
there is not even a shred of evidence that it exists at all . 

The future of symptomatology will clearly rest with program 
developments using computer techniques derived from studies of 
artificial intelligence.  These are intended to mime and comple-



Symptom Signs 81  

ment, i f  not to replace, human semiosic processes, such as judg­
ment  based on intuition (in one word, abduction) . Such diagnostic 
counsellors are already operational, as for example the program 
termed Caduceus (McKean 1 982) . This program 

examines a patient with fever, blood in the urine ,  bloody sputum from 
the lungs, and jaundice. The program adds together numbers that show 
how much each symptom is related to four possible diagnoses - cirrhosis 
of the liver, hepatitis, pneumonia, and nephritis - and picks pneumonia 
as top contender. The runner-up in score is hepatitis. But because 

, hepatitis has one symptom not shared with pneumonia (blood in the 
urine) , Caduceus chooses cirrhosis as first alternative . This process, 
called parti tioning, focuses the computer's attention on groups of related 
diseases. ( McKean 1 982: 64) 

The craft of interpreting symptoms has a significance far exceed­
ing the physician 's day-to-day management of sickness. As Hippo­
crates had already anticipated, its success derives from its 
psychological power, which critically depends on the practitioner's 
ability to impress his/her skills on both the patient and their joint 
environment ( the audience gathered in his/her workshop,  which 
may consist of the patient's family and friends, as well as the physi­
cian 's colleagues and staff) . Dr Joseph Bell, of the Royal Infirmary 
of Edinburgh , attained the knack with panache, leaving his 
imprint on the detective story, following in the footsteps of Dr 
Arthur Conan Doyle 's  fictional realization , Sherlock Holmes 
(Sebeok 1 981 , Ginzburg 1 983) . According to recent  medical think­
ing, the contemporary preoccupation with diagnosis - that is, doc­
tor 's perceived task, or pivotal drive , being to explain the meaning 
of the patient's condition - rests in the final analysis with the doc­
tor's  self-assigned role as an authenticated expositor and explica­
tor of the values of contemporary society. Disease is thus elevated 
to the status of a moral category, and the sorting of symptoms had 
therefore best be viewed as a system of semiotic taxonomy - or, in 
Russian semiotic parlance, a ' secondary modelling system. ' 

Lord Horder's dictum - ' that the most important thing in medi­
cine is diagnosis, the second most important thing is diagnosis and 



82 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

the third most important thing is diagnosis ' (Lawrence 1 982)  -

must be true, because medical knowledge has risen to the status of 
a means of social control . Symptomatology has turned out to be 
that branch of semiotics that teaches us the ways in which doctors 
function within their cultural milieu.

Indexical Signs 

The poet Joseph Brodsky ( 1 989 : 44) has recently remarked that a 
study in genealogy 'normally is owing to either pride in one's 
ancestry or  uncertainty about it. ' Indeed, most contemporary 
workers in semiotics proudly trace their lineage, or try to, to 
Peirce,  whom Max Fisch ( 1 980: 7) once justly characterized as ' the 
most original and versatile intellect that the Americas have so far 
produced . '  In this, he perhaps echoed Peirce's student and some­
time collaborator in the early 1 880s, Joseph Jastrow ( 1 930: 1 35) , 
who called his teacher ' one of the most exceptional minds that 
America has produced' and 'a mathematician of first rank. ' 

Of course , intimations of Western semiotics - sometimes under 
I the distinctly indexical nom de g;uerer  ' sem (e) iotic '  - which, in a 

sense , culminated with Peirce, gradually sprouted out of the haze 
I of millennia before him. And the ' doctrine'  of signs,  to which 

Peirce imparted so critical a spin, today clearly continues to flour­
ish almost everywhere. His reflection (8 :41 ) that ' human inquiries 
- human reasoning and observation - tend toward the settlement 
of disputes and ultimate agreement in definite conclusions which 
are independent of the particular standpoints from which the dif­
ferent  inquirers may have set out' holds surely no less for semiotics 
than it  applies in other domains of study and research . 

In this chapter, I will look more closely at one of Peirce 's great­
est contributions to the study of semiosis - his notion of ' indexical­
ity. ' It should go without saying that this Peircean category, like 
every other, cannot be well understood piecemeal ,  without taking 



84 Signs:  An Introduction to Semiotics 

in to account, at much the same time,  the veri table cascade of other 
irreducible triadic relational structures which make up the arma­
ture of Peirce 's semiotic - indeed, without coming to terms with 
his philosophy in its entirety. But this ideal procedure would be 
mandatory only were I bent on exegesis rather than engaged - tak­
ing Peirce 's  ideas as a kind of beacon - in a quest of my own . I 
should nonetheless give at least one example of the dilemma of 
selectivity by noting how Peirce tied together his notions of deduc­
tion and indexicality (2 :96) : 

An Obsistent Argument, or Deduction, is an argument representing facts 
in the Premiss, such that when we come to represent them in a Diagram 
we find ourselves compelled to represent the fact stated in the Conclu­
sion; so that the Conclusion is drawn to recognize that, quite independ­
ently of whether it be recognized or not, the facts stated in the premisses 
are such as could not be if the fact stated in the conclusion were not 
there ;  that is to say, the Conclusion is drawn in acknowledgement that the 
facts in the premisses constitute an Index of the fact which it is thus 
compelled to acknowledge. 

Indexicality 

It was Rulon Wells ( 1 967: 1 04) who,  in an article that even today 
amply rewards close study for its extraordinary fecundity, argued 
the following three interesting claims: 

l . that Peirce 's notion of the icon is as old as Plato 's  ( i . e . ,  that the 
sign imitates the signified) ; 

2. that Peirce's notion of the symbol is original but fruitless; 

3. that it is 'wi th his notion of index that Peirce is at once novel and 
fruitful. ' 

I will discuss some implications of the first of these statements in 
the next chapter. This is not the place to debate the second.  The 
third assertion is - I enthusiastically concur wi th Wells - doubtless 



Indexical Signs 85 

true . Peirce 's views on the index may in truth have been histori­
cally rooted in his interest in the realism of Scotus; ' hic and nunc, ' 
he once observed,  ' is the phrase perpetually in the mouth of Duns 
Scotus' ( 1  :458) . 'The index, '  he later amplified,  'has the being of 
present  experience ' (4 :447) . Whatever the attested sources of his 
ideas on this topic may have been, his innovativeness with respect 
to the index is, as Wells ( 1 967: 1 04) noted, due to the fact that 
Peirce saw, as no one before him had done,  ' that indication (point­
ing, ostension,  deixis) is a mode of signification as indispensable as 
it is irreducible . ' 

Peirce contended that no matter of fact can be stated with­
out the use of some sign serving as an index, because designators 
compose one of the main classes of indexes. He regarded designa­
tions as ' absolutely indispensable both to communication and to 
thought. No assertion has any meaning unless there is some desig­
nation to show whether the universe of reality or what universe of 
fiction is referred to ' (8 :368) . Deictics of various sorts ,  including 
tenses, consti tute perhaps the most clear-cut examples of designa­
tions. Peirce identified universal and existential quantifiers with 
selective pronouns, which he classified with designations as well 
(2 :289) . 

He called his other main class of indexes reagents. Since reagents 
may be used to ascertain facts, li ttle wonder they became the staple 
of detective fiction,  as was dazzlingly demonstrated in the famous 
Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes duet in 'The Greek Interpreter' and 
thereafter replayed by Conan Doyle 's countless copycats. 

Space permits but a single cited exemplification here of how this 
detectival method of abduction (alias ' deduction ' )  ( see Eco and 
Sebeok 1 983) works in some detail . The rei signum of my choice 
(Quintilian 8 .6 .22)  involves, as i t  turns out, a bay mare , or yet 
another horse , an animal which , for obscure reasons, has been 
favoured in this context by dozens of novelists, from the 1 747 epi­
sode of the king's horse in Voltaire 's Zadig, to the chronicle of 
Silver Blaze ,  John Straker's racehorse , to the many ensuing race­
horses of Dick Francis, and finally to Baskerville 's  incident of the 
abbot's horse , by Eco. My parodic pick comes from Dorothy L. 
Sayers's novel Have His Carcase ( 1 932: 209-1 0) . 



86 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

In chapter 16 Harriet Vane hands over to Lord Peter Wimsey a 
shoe she has just found on the beach . He  then proceeds to recon­
struct - ex alio aliud etiam intellegitur (Quintilian 8.6.22) - a horse 
from this synecdoche: 

He ran his fingers gently round the hoop of metal, clearing the sand 
away. 

' It's a new shoe - and it hasn 't  been here very long. Perhaps a week, 
perhaps a little more. Belongs to a nice little cob, about fourteen hands. 
Pretty little animal, fairly well-bred, rather given to kicking her shoes off, 
pecks a little with the off-fore . '  

'Holmes, this i s  wonderful ! How do  you do  it? ' 
'Perfectly simple , my dear Watson .  The shoe hasn ' t  been worn thin by 

the ' ammer, 'ammer, 'ammer on the 'ard ' igh road, therefore ,  it's 
reasonably new. It's a little rusty from lying in the water, but hardly at all 
rubbed by sand and stones, and not at all corroded, which suggests that it 
hasn 't  been here long. The size of the shoe gives the size of the nag, and 
the shape suggests a nice little round, well-bred hoof. Though newish, the 
shoe isn ' t  fire-new, and it is worn down a li ttle on the inner front edge , 
which shows that the wearer was disposed to peck a little; while the way 
the nails are placed and clinched indicates that the smith wanted to make 
the shoe extra secure - which is why I said that a lost shoe was a fairly 
common accident with this particular gee .  Still, we needn 't blame him or 
her too much. With all these stones about, a slight trip or knock might 
easily wrench a shoe away. ' 

'Him or her. Can ' t  you go OIl and tell the sex and colour while you 're 
about it? '  

' I  am afraid even I have limitations, my dear Watson . '  

'Well, that's quite a pretty piece of  deduction . '  

Peirce (2 :289) pointed out that ' a  scream for help is not only 
intended to force upon the mind the knowledge that help is 
wanted ,  but also to force the will to accord it. ' As discussed in the 
previous chapter, perhaps Peirce 's best-known example of a 
reagent  - although a disconcerting one,  for it seems exempt from 
his general rule that an index would lose its character as a sign if i t  



Indexical Signs 87 

had no interpretant (Ayer 1 968: 153)  - involved 'a piece of mould 
with a bullet-hole in it as a sign of a shot; for without a shot there 
would have been no hole ; but there is a hole there ,  whether any­
body has the sense to attribute it to a shot or not' ( 2 :304) . Here 
belong motor signs as well, as is commonly the case , they serve to 
indicate the state of mind of the utterer; however, if a gesture 
serves merely to call attention to its utterer, it is but a designation.  

An index, as Peirce spelled out further, ' is a sign which refers to 
the Object it denotes by virtue of being really affected by that 
Object' ( 2 : 248) - where the word ' really' resonates to Scotus's doc­
trine of realitas et realitas, postulating a real world in which univer­
sals exist and general principles manifest themselves in the sort of 
cosmos that scientists try to decipher. 

Peirce specified that, ' insofar as the Index is affected by the 
Object, it necessarily has some Quality in common wi th the Object, 
and it is in respect to these that it refers to the Object'  (2 :305) . He 
further noted that it is a ' sign , or representation,  which refers to  its 

, object not so much because of any similarity or analogy with it, nor 
, because it is associated with general characters which that object 

happens to possess, as because it  is in dynamical (including spatial ) 
connection both with the individual object, on the one hand, and 
with the senses or memory of the person whom it  serves as a sign , 
on the other hand. '  Let it be recalled that all objects ,  on the one 
hand, and the memory, being a reservoir of interpretants, on the 
other hand,  are also kinds of signs or systems of signs. 

Thus indexicality hinges upon association by con tiguity, a tech­
nical expression Peirce (3 :41 9)  understandably disliked,  and not, 

, as iconicity does, by likeness; nor does it rest, in the manner of a 
symbol, on ' intellectual operations. ' Indexes, 'whose relation to 
their objects consists in a correspondence in fact  . . .  direct the 
attention to their objects by blind compulsion ' ( 1 :558) . 

A grisly instance (only recen tly laid to rest) of association by con­
tiguity was the right arm of the Mexican General Alvaro Obregon.  
Lost at  the elbow during a battle in 1 9 1 5 ,  the limb had until the 
summer of 1 989 been on display in a jar of formaldehyde at a large 
marble monument in Mexico City, where it acquired talismanic 
quali ties referring to the ruthless former president. When the 



88 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez suggested (Rohter 1 989) that 
' they should just replace [ the decaying appendage ] wi th another 
arm, '  he was effectively advocating that the limb be transfigured 
from an index with a mystical aura into a symbol with historical 
significance. 

Features of Indexicality 

Iconicity and indexicality have often been polarized - although 
never by Peirce - with the same comparable labels in the most vari­
ous fields, as if the two categories are antagonistic rather than com­
plementary (Sebeok 1985: 77) . So, for instance : 

• James G. Frazer contrasted homeopathic with contagious magic, 
' the magical sympathy which is supposed to exist between a man 
and any severed portion of his person ' ;  

• the Gestalt psychologist Max Wertheimer set apart a 'factor of 
similarity' from a ' factor of proximity' ; 

• the neuropsychologist Alexander Luria distinguished similarity 
disorders from con tiguity disorders in aphasic patients ;  

• linguists in the Saussurean tradition differentiated the paradig­
matic from the syn tagmatic axis, opposition from contrast, etc .  

Contiguity is actualized in rhetoric,  among other devices, by the 
trope of me tonymy: the replacement of an entity by one of its 
indexes. The possessive relation between an entity and its index 
is often realized in grammar by the geni tive case (Thorn 1 973 :  95-
8) , as in Shakespeare 's  couplet 'Eye of newt, and toe of frog / 
Wool of bat, and tongue of dog' (Macbeth) , with the preposition ; 
and his line '0 tiger's heart wrapp'd in a woman 's hide ' ( King 
Henry VI) , without one . The pars pro toto proportion is also at the 
core of the an thropological and,  in particular, psycho-sexual semi­
otic category known as ' fetish , '  as will be discussed in chapter 6 
(see also Sebeok 1 989) . In poetics, lyric verse has sometimes been 



Indexical Signs 89 

professed to be imbued with iconicity; in contrast, epics are charac­
terized as being imbued with indexicality. 

The closely related notion of ostension , launched by Russell in 

, 1 948, and later developed by Quine,  in the sense of ostensive 
definition , should be alluded to here at least in passing. The 
Czech theater semiotician Ivo Osolsobe ( 1 979) has extensively 
analysed this concept in the somewhat different context of ' osten­
sive communication . '  This is sometimes also called ' presenta­
tion ' or ' showing. ' Osolsobe wants to sharply distinguish osten­
sion from idexicality, deixis, natural signs, communication by 
objects ,  and the like . However, I find his paradoxical assertion 
that ' ostension is the cognitive use of non-signs, '  and his elabora­
tion of a theory of ostension as a theory of non-signs, muddled 
and perplexing. 

Temporal succession, relations of a cause to i ts effect or of an 
effect to its cause , or else some space/time vinculum between an 
index and its dynamic object, as Berkeley and Hume had already 
discovered but as Peirce went much farther to elaborate , lurk at 
the heart of indexicality. The epidemiologists, responsible for 
investigating the outbreak of a disease ( i .e . ,  an effect) impinging 
upon a large number of people in a given locality, seek for a source 
carrier ( i . e . ,  a causative agent) , whom they call ,  in the root purport 
of their professional jargon, an ' index case , '  who,  and only who,  
had been exposed, say, to an unknown viral stockpile . I t  is in this 
sense that a Canadian airline steward, Gaetan Dugas, also known as 
the infamous ' Patient Zero , '  was supposedly identified as the index 
case for AIDS infection in North America. 

A given object can,  depending on the circumstance in which it is 
displayed, momentarily function , to a degree,  in the role of an 
icon , an index , or a symbol. Witness the Stars and Stripes: 

• Iconicity comes to the fore when the interpreter's attention fas­
tens upon the seven red horizontal stripes of the flag alternating 
with six white ones ( together identical with the number of 
founding colonies) , or the number of white stars clustered in a 
single blue canton (in all ,  identical to the number of actual 
states in the Union) . 



90 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

• In a cavalry charge, say, the flag was commonly employed to 
imperatively point, in an indexical fashion , to a targe t. 

• The debates pursuant to the recent Supreme Court decision on 
the issue of flag burning present the Stars and Stripes as an emo­
tionally surcharged problem, being a subspecies of symbol. 

Peirce once stated uncommonly loosely that a sign 'is either an 
icon, an index, or a symbol' (2 :304) . But this plainly cannot be so. 
Once Peirce realized that the utility of his trichotomy was greatly 
enhanced when,  in order to allow for the recognition of differ­
ences in degree,  not signs but rather aspects of signs are being 
classified, he emended his statement thus: 'it would be difficult if 
not impossible,  to instance an absolutely pure index, or to find 
any sign absolutely devoid of the indexical quality' (2 :306) , 
although he did allow demonstrative and relative pronouns to 
be 'nearly pure indices, ' on the ground that they denote things 
but do not describe them (3 :361 ) .  Ransdell ( 1 986: 341 )  rightly 
emphasized that one and the same sign can - and,  I would in­
sist, must - ' function at once as an icon and symbol as well as 
an index ' ;  in other words, that all signs necessarily partake of 
' secondness, ' although this aspect is prominently upgraded on ly 
in certain contexts. 

Peirce , who fully recognized that an utterer and an interpre ter 
of a sign need not be persons at all ,  would not in the least h ave 
been shocked to learn that semiosis, in the indexical relation of 
secondness - along with its elder and younger siblings, firstness 
and thirdness - appeared in terrestrial evolution about 3.6 X l Oll 
years ago.  Too ,  in human ontogenesis, secondness is a universal of 
infant pre-speech communicative behaviour (Trevarthen 1 990) . 
The reason for this is that the prime reciprocal implication 
between ego, a distinct sign maker, and alter, a distinguishable sign 
in terpreter - neither of which , I repeat, need be an integrated 
organism - is innate in the very fabric of the emergen t, inter-sub­
jective , dialogic mind ( Braten 1 988) . 

Signs, inclusive of indexes, occur at their most primitive on the 



Indexical Signs 9 1  

single-cell level ,  as physical o r  chemical entities, external o r  inter­
nal with respect to the embedding organism as a reference frame ,  
which they may 'point' to, read, or microsemiotically parse - in  
brief, can issue functional instructions for in  the manner of  an 
index. Such an index, which may be as simple as a change in mag­
nitude , a mere shape, a geometric change in surface area, or some 
singularity, can be significant to a cell because it  evokes memories, 
that is, exposes previously masked stored information .  

The following striking example , from the life o f  the ubiquitous 
prokaryotic bacterium E. coli, was provided by Berg ( 1 976) . This 
single-celled creature has multiple flagellae that it can rotate either 
clockwise or coun ter-clockwise . When its flagellae rotate clockwise , 
they fly apart, causing the organism to tumble .  When they rotate 
counter-clockwise , they are drawn together into a bundle which 
acts as a propeller to produce smooth ,  directed swimming. Roam­
ing about in the gut, the bacterium explores a chemical field for 
nutrients by alternating - its context serving as operator - between 
tumbling and directed swimming until i t  finds an optimally appro­
priate concentration of chemical attractant, such as sugar or an 
amino acid,  for its replication. In doing so, it relies on a memory 
lasting approximately four seconds, allowing it  to compare deicti­
cally, over short times and distances, where it was with where it is .  
On that basis ,  i t  'decides, '  with seeming intentionality, whether to 
tumble , stay in place , or swim and search for another indexical 
match somewhere else . 

It may be pertinent to note that, with respect to their rhythmic 
movements, the hic et nunc that we humans perceive has a duration 

"
of three seconds. Poets and composers appear to be intuitively 
aware of this fact when they provide proper 'pauses '  in their texts .  
Recent ethological work in societies the world over on ostensive 
and other body posture movements of an indexical character 
reveal that there are no cultural differences in the duration of 
these kinds of behaviours and that the time intervals last an aver­
age of 2 seconds for repeated gestures and 2 .9 seconds for non­
repeated gestures. According to the researchers, the 3 second 
' time window' appears to be fully used up in these circumstances. 



92 Signs :  An Introduction to Semiotics 

Manifestations of Indexicality 

The brilliant neo-Kantian theoretical and experimental biologist 
Jakob von Uexkull ( 1 864-1 944) , labouring in Hamburg in a very 
different scientific tradition and employing a discrepant  but 
readily reconciliable technical jargon, was laying down the founda­
tions of biosemiotics and setting forth the principles of phytosemi­
otics and zoosemiotics at roughly the same time as Peirce was 
elaborating general semiotics in the solitude of Milford. Unfortu­
nately, neither knew of the other. 

I t  fell to a contemporary German semiotician , Martin Krampen, 
in collaboration with Uexkull ' s  elder son , Thure , to show in detail 
why and precisely how the Peircean distinctions apply to plan ts. 
Krampen ( 1 981 : 1 95-6) wrote in part: 

If one wants to extend this trichotomy to plants on the one hand, versus 
animals and humans on the other, the absence of the function cycle 
[which, in animals, connects receptor organs via a nervous system to 
effector organs] would suggest that, in plants, indexicality certainly 
predominates over iconicity . . .  Indexicality, on the vegetative level ,  
corresponds to the sensing and regulating, in a feedback cycle, of 
meaningful stimulation directly contiguous to the form of the plant. 

Mter all , as Peirce once mused (3 :205) , ' even plants make their liv­
ing . . .  by uttering signs. ' 

Indexical behaviour is found in abundance in animals too .  As 
discussed in the previous chapter, the bird presciently named Indi­
cator indicator by its ornithologist taxonomer is more commonly 
known as the 'black-throated honey-guide ' in English . The honey­
guide 's  singular habit of beckoning and pointing various large 
mammals, including humans, towards nests of wild bees was first 
noted in southwest Mozambique in 1 569 . When the bird discovers 
a hive , it may seek out a human partner, whom it then pilots to the 
hive by means of an elaborate audiovisual display. 

The display proceeds roughly in the following manner. The nor­
mally inconspicuous honey-guide calls out, emitting a continuous 
sequence of chirring notes. Then it flies, in stages, to the nearest 



Indexical Signs 93 

tree ,  lingering motionless on an easily seen branch until the pur­
suit  recommences. When embarking on a flight - which may last 
from two to twenty minutes and extend from 20 to 750 metres -
the bird soars with an initial downward dip, i ts white tail feathers 
saliently outspread. Its agitated ostensive comportment continues 
until the vicinity of the objective , a bees' nest, is reached. Avian 
escorts and their human followers are also capable of reversing 
their roles in this indexical pas de deux: people can summon a 
honey-guide by mimicking the sound of a tree being felled, 
thereby triggering the behaviour sequence described.  

Such words as symptom, cue, clue, track, trail, and so forth,  are 
among the high number of English quasi-synonyms of index. I 
return once again to Peirce 's telling example of secondness - that 
footprint Robinson Crusoe found in the sand, 'and which has been 
stamped in the granite of fame , '  and which 'was an Index to him 
that some creature was on his island'  (4 :53 1 ) .  This illustrates a key 
attribute of indexicality, to wit: the operation of renvoi, or referral , 
which directs Robinson Crusoe back to some day, presuably prior 
to Friday, in the past. The index, as i t  were , inverts causali ty. In Fri­
day's case, the vector of the index points to a bygone day in that a 
signans, the imprint of some foot  in the sand, temporally rebounds 
to a signatum, the highly probable presence of some other creature 
on the island. Thorn ( 1 980) has analysed some fascinating ramifi­
cations of parallels, or the lack of them, between semiotic transfers 
of this sort and physical causality and the genesis of symbols - the 
footprint which , Peirce noted, at the same time 'as a Symbol, called 
up the idea of a man . '  

The historian Carlo Ginzburg ( 1 983) has exposed commonali­
ties among art historians who study features of paintings by means 
of the so-called 'Morelli method, '  medical diagnosticians and psy­
choanalysts bent on eliciting symptoms, and detectives in pursuit 
of clues. Ginzburg invokes a canonical trio of physicians - Dr 
Morelli, Dr Freud, and Dr Conan Doyle - to make out a very con­
vincing case for their and their colleagues' parallel dependence on 
indexical signs. He shows that their historical provenance, fea­
tures, symptoms, clues, and the like , are all based on the same 
ancient semiotic paradigm: the medical .  (As discussed in the previ-



94 Signs: An In troduction to Semiotics 

ous chapter, that model was of course implicit in the Hippocratic 
writings and made explicit by Galen . )  

Indexes included for Peirce 'all natural signs and physical symp­
toms . . .  a pointing finger being the type of the class' (3 :361 ) .  The 
' signs which become such by virtue of being really connected with 
their objects' comprehended for him ' the letters attached to parts 
of a diagram ' as much as ' a  symptom of disease ' (8 :  1 1 9) .  Writing to 
Lady Welby, he contrasted ' the occurrence of a symptom of a 
disease . . .  a legisign , a general type of a definite character, '  to its 
'occurrence in a particular case [which is] a sinsign ' ( 8:335 ) . 

Ginzburg ( 1 983:  88-9) has adroitly traced back the origins of 
the medical model based upon the decipherment and interpre­
tation of clues, clinical and otherwise , to two coupled sources: 
( 1 )  early hunting practices, as proto-humans retrogressed from 
the effects ,  an animal ' s  tracks and other leavings - prints in soft 
ground, snapped twigs, droppings, snagged hairs or feathers, 
smells, puddles, threads of saliva - to their actual cause, a yet 
unseen quarry; and (2 )  Mesopotamian divinatory techniques, pro­
gressing magically from an actual present cause to a prognosti­
cated future effect - animals' innards, drops of oil in water, stars, 
involuntary movements .  

Ginzburg'S subtle arguments,  which make learned use of the 
overarching medieval and modern comparison between the world 
- metaphorically, the Book of Nature - and the book, both 
assumed to lie open ready to be read once one knows how to in ter­
pret  indexical signs, draw comprehensively upon Old World 
sources. But he could as easily have cited nineteenth-century 
American fiction, such as James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstock­
ing saga, to other mythic accounts of 'Noble Savages , '  to illustrate 
dependence on sequences of indexical cues, available to immedi­
ate perception,  which enabled the art of pathfinding through the 
wilderness landscape.  Thus alone,  U ncas, the last of the Mohicans, 
is able to read a language , namely, the Book of Nature, ' that would 
prove too much for the wisest' of white men,  Hawkeye; so also 
Uncas's  crucial discovery of a footprint, in one Cooper's novels, 
makes it possible for Hawkeye to confidently assert, ' I  can noW 
read the whole of it '  (Sebeok 1 990) . 



Indexical Signs 95 

So also Robert Baden-Powell, in his military manual Reconnais­
sance and Scouting ( 1 884) , adapted Sherlock Holmes's technique of 
'deduction, ' that is, inferring important conclusions from seem­

. ingly insignificant clues, when teaching his young troopers how to 
I interpret  enemy locations and intentions by studying indexical 

topographical signs,  including footprin ts. 
For the farmer, forester, and professional gardener, i t  is essen­

tial , if only for reasons of economy, to be able to sort out animal 
tracks (Bang and Dahlstrom 1 972) . We know from contemporary 
field naturalists' accounts that nature con tinually provides a record 
of the previous night's activi ties printed in the ground for anyone 
who cares to follow them.  Thus Tinbergen (Ennion and Tinber­
gen 1 967) used to spend many an hour in countryside detection, 
reading the stories written in footprint  code, revelling in the pat­
terns of ligh t and shade in the stillness of the morning. 

The body of any vertebrate , including humans, is composed of a 
veritable armamentarium of more or less palpable indexical mark­
ers of unique selfhood. Certain mantic practices like haruspication 
from patterns of liver flukes and palmistry but also some highly 
consequential pseudo-sciences - graphology today (Furnham 
1988) , phrenology in the past - hinge pivotally on secondness; 
according to Kevles's ( 1 985 :6)  awesome account, the chief of the 
London Phrenological Institution told Francis Galton, himself to 
become no mean biometrician , that people of his head type - his 
skull measured twenty-two inches around - 'possessed a sanguine 
temperament, with considerable self-will ,  self-regard, and no small 
share of obstinacy' and that ' there is much enduring power in 
such a mind as this - much that qualifies a man for roughing it  in 
colonising. ' 

Some forms of entertainment, such as stage conjury and circus 
animal acts, rely crucially on the manipulation of indexical signs. 
So do certain crafts, such as handwriting authentication and, of 
COurse, identification, criminal or otherwise , by fingerprinting 
(Moenssens 1 971 ) - mentioned no less than seven times by Sher­
lock Holmes - according to a phenotypic system devised by Galton 
in the 1 890s. In 1 894 Mark Twain 's fictional character Pudd'nhead 
Wilson became the first lawyer in the world to use fingerprints in a 



96 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

criminal case , antedating Scotland Yard by eight years . Such 
indexes are called in the business 'professional signs. '  Erving Goff­
man ( 1 963: 56) , the distinguished sociologist, called them 'positive 
marks ' or ' identity pegs . '  Preziosi ( 1 989 : 94-5) further connects 
the methods of Morelli, Vol taire 's Zadig, Sherlock Holmes, and 
Freud with Hyppolyte Taine's  petits faits, or his system of cultural 
and artistic indexes, and with Peirce. 

All such devices likewise richly hinge on secondness, as was 
already evident in proto-semiotic works like Alphonse Bertillon ' s 
Service de signalements ( 1 888) and Instructions signaletiques ( 1 893) . 
He dubbed his system of measurements of the body 'anthro­
pometry. '  On the genotypic plane, so-called 'DNA fingerprinting' 
can , arguably, identify with a discrimination far beyond anything 
available in forensics heretofore - in fact, with absolute certainty, if 
properly used - every individual , excepting an identical twin ,  even 
by a single hair root on a small piece of film displaying his or her 
unique sequence of indexical DNA molecules. 

The Study of Indexicality 

Natural sciences in general work empirically by decoding indexes 
and then interpreting them.  The crystallographer Alan Mackay 

j 1 984) in particular has shown how his field shares with divination 
'a belief that nature can be made to speak to us in some metalan­
guage about i tself, a feeling that nature is written in a kind of 
code , '  land how augurers decode nature 's  indexical messages by 
magic, scientists by logic . Crystallographers are strongly and con­
sciously influenced by techniques of decryption, and they have 
heavily borrowed from the semiotic vocabulary of the cryptogra­
phers :  for example, they speak of X-ray diffraction photographs as 
message texts .  

The distinctive pheromonal function of human chemical signa­
tures (Toller and Dodd 1989 ) , nowadays studied under the newly 
designated scientific rubric of ' semiochemistry, ' has in fact been 
compared with individual fingerprints.  Patrick Susskind based his 
beautifully researched novel Das Perfum entirely on the indexical 
facets of human semiochemistry and its devastating repercussions. 



Indexical Signs 97 

The field encompasses the study of odours, of which Peirce ( 1 :3 1 3)  
wrote in an amazingly lyrical ,  yet seldom remembered, passage 
that these 'are signs in more than one way' which 'have a remark­
able tendency to presentmentate themselves . . .  namely, by contigu­
ous association, in which odors are particularly apt to act as signs. ' 
He continued in this personal vein: 

A lady's favorite perfume seems to me somehow to agree with that of her 
spiritual being. If she uses none at all her nature will lack perfume . If she 
wears violet she herself will have the same delicate finesse . Of the only 
two I have known to use rose , one was an artistic old virgin,  a wand 
dame; the other a noisy young matron and very ignorant; but they were 
strangely alike . As for those who use heliotrope, frangipanni, e tc . ,  I know 
them as well as I desire to know them, Surely there must be some subtle 
resemblance between the odor and the impression I get of this or that 
woman's  nature . 

Our immune system utilizes approximately as large a number of 
cells dispersed throughout our body as the number of cells that 
composes a human brain . These endosymbiotic - or, as I would 
prefer, endosemiotic - aggregations of spirochetal remnants,  func­
tioning - as the Nobel laureate Niels Jerne ( 1 985) has shown - in 
the open-ended manner of a finely tuned generative grammar, 
constitute an extremely sensitive , sophisticated repertory of indexi­
cal signs, circumscribing, under normal conditions, our unique 
biological selfhood. Sadly, secondness can go awry under patholog­
ical conditions, when,  for instance, one is afflicted with certain 
types of carcinoma or an auto-immune disease , or ultimately even 
when administered immuno-suppressors after an organ transplant. 

Most of the huge literature on indexicality has been played out 
either in the verbal arena or else in the visual (Sonesson 1 989: 38-
65) . Peirce was right as usual in arguing for the predominance of 
indexicality over iconicity, with respect to the mode of production, 
in photographs: ' they belong to the second class of signs, those by 
physical connection '  (2 :28 1 ) .  This has now been documented in 
Phillippe Dubois's outstanding study, L'Acte photographique ( 1 988) . 
And it has long been obvious that metonymy - especially the index-



98 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

ical method of pars pro toto - far outweighs the uses of metaphor in 
films. 

In the verbal domain, indexicality has chiefly preoccupied , 
although with rather differing emphases, philosophers of language 
and professional linguists . Bar-Hillel 's  ( 1 970) conspectus is useful 
in this regard. Bar-Hillel knew, of course , that it was Peirce who 
had launched the terms ' indexical sign ' and ' index. ' He goes on to 
remind his readers that Russell used instead ' ego-centric particu­
lars , '  though without resolving whether Russell rediscovered 
indexicality independently of Peirce or simply relabelled it. He fur­
ther recalls that Nelson Goodman coined ' indicator' and Reichen­
bach ' token-reflexive word. ' 

The overall interest of l inguists and philosophers in indexical 
expressions is bound up, as I understand i t, with their search for an 
ideal language , consisting of a set of context-free sentences, to use 
as an instrument for probing the universe sub specie aeternitatis. In 
Ayer's ( 1 968: 1 67)  phrasing, the argument has been about 'whether 
language can be totally freed from dependence upon context. ' Ayer 
was unable to decide this for himself, and I believe that the matter 
is still wide open. However, whether or not this indecision has any 
serious consequences for indexicality in general or for Peirce 's view 
of this matter in particular seems to me quite doubtful .  For as Ayer 
( 1 968: 1 67)  thought as well , ' al though a reference to context within 
the language may not be necessary for the purposes of communica­
tion, there will still be occasions, in practice, when we shall need to 
rely upon the clues which are provided by the actual circumstances 
in which the communications are produced. ' 

Peirce once insisted that an index was quite essential to speech 
(4 :58) . So what do linguists mean by an index? For many, this term 
simply and broadly refers to membership-identifying characteris­
tics of a group,  such as regional ,  social , or occupational markers; 
for others, more narrowly, to such physiological , psychological , or 
social features of speech or writing that reveal personal characteris­
tics as the voice quality or handwriting in a producing source . 
Indexicals of these sorts, sometimes called expressive features, 
have been analysed for many languages and in a wide range of 
theoretical contributions. 



Indexical Signs 99 

In addition, there is a vast, separate l iterature , not as a rule sub­
sumed by linguists under indexicality, devoted to different types of 
deixis. By this linguists refer to a whole range of commonly gram­
maticalized roles in everyday language behaviour, that is, to the 
ways in which interlocutors anchor what they talk about to the spa­
tio-temporal context of their utterance.  Person deixis, social deixis, 
place deixis, time deixis, and discourse deixis are the major types 
distinguished in the literature (Levelt 1 989:  44-58) . Karl Buhler 
( 1 934: 1 07)  called the relevant context of the utterance Zeigfeld, or 
indexical field, and the anchoring point of this hie et nunc field its 
Origo, or origin (see also Jarvella and Klein 1 982) . 

Deictics can vary considerably from language to language and 
can often be - as, for example, in Wolof (Wills 1 990)  - very knotty 
in structure . One examination of the typological and universal 
characteristics of personal pronouns in general , over a sample of 
seventy-one natural languages, claimed the existence of systems 
ranging from four to fifteen persons ( Ingram 1 978) . In this array, 
the English five-person system seems highly atypical, and if this 
were true, i t  could lead to fundamen tal questions about Peirce's  
and other philosophers' seemingly natural ' I-I t-Thou' tripartition. 

Only a native speaker of Hungarian can appreciate , if not always 
articulate, the richly differentiated set of terms of address which 
speakers must control to produce utterances appropriate to vari­
ous roles and other contextual variables.  For instance , to simplify, 
but not much : two academics of the same sex and approximate 
rank and age are unable to converse at ease in Hungarian without 
knowing each other's exact date of birth , because seniority, even if 
by one day, strictly determines the terms of address to be used in 
that dialogue (see also Lyons 1 977) . 

Otto Jespersen ( 1 922)  casually coined the term ' shifter '  to refer 
to grammatical units which cannot be defined without a reference 
to the message . In 1 957 Jakobson reassigned shifters to the 
Peircean syncretic category of indexical symbols, which are , in fact, 
complex syncategorematic terms, where code and message inter­
sect ( 1 97 1 :  1 32 ) . 

In a remarkable study of a single four-word sen tence consisting 
of a modal auxiliary, a person-deictic pronoun , a verb, and the 



1 00 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

verb 's complement, Fillmore ( 1 973) has hinted at the incredible 
intricacy demanded of a linguistic theory if it is to adequately cap­
ture the conceptual richness of even the simplest sentences. Such a 
theory must incorporate principles for deriving at least the com­
plete syntactic,  semantic, and pragmatic description of a sentence , 
a theory of speech acts, a theory of discourse , and a theory of natu­
ral logic. Although all of these are foci of a considerable amount of 
research activity today, I know of no overarching theory which 
meets all of these demanding conditions. 

Barwise and Perry ( 1 983: 32-9) coined the expression ' efficiency 
of language ' for locutions - even though these retain the same lin­
guistic meaning - which different speakers use in different  space­
time locations and with different anchoring in their surroundings, 
and which are susceptible to different interpretations. To put i t  
another way, the productivity of  language depends decisively on 
indexicality, which is therefore ' extremely important to the infor­
mation-carrying capacity of language . '  These authors convincingly 
argue that philosophical engrossment with context freedom, that 
is, wi th mathematics and the e ternal nature of its sentences, 'was a 
critical blunder, for efficiency lies at the very heart of meaning . '  
However this may be , linguists at  present  have no inkling of, le t  
alone a comprehensive theory for, how this commonplace ,  global 
human enterprise is carried out. 

Perhaps the most one can do is to follow Jacob von Uexkiill 's  
suggestion (see Thure von Uexkiill 1 989) that reality reveals i tself 
in Umwelten, or those parts of the environment that each organism 
selects with its species-specific sense organs,  each according to its 
biological needs. Everything in th is phenomenal world ,  or self­
world,  is labelled with the subject's perceptual cues and effector 
cues, which operate via a feedback loop that Uexkiill called the 
functional cycle . Nature ( the world,  the universe , the cosmos, true 
reality, etc . )  discloses itself through sign processes, or semioses .  
These are of three distinct types: 

• semioses of information , emanating from the inanimate enVI­
ronment; 



Indexical Signs 10 1  

• semioses o f  symptomatization, where the source is alive ( this is 
equivalent to George Herbert Mead's  'unintelligent gestures' ) ;  

• semioses of communication ( Mead's  ' intelligent gestures ' ) .  

The first and second form indispensable ,  complementary steps 
in each biosemiosis. The observer reconstructs the exterior sign 
processes of the observed from the perceived stream of indexes,  
but never their interior s tructures,  which necessarily remain pri­
vate . The transmutation of such sign processes into verbal signs are 
meta-interpretations which constitute objective connecting struc­
tures that remain outside the subjective world of the observed liv­
ing entity; these are ' involved in its sign processes only as an 
inducing agency for its perceptual sign and as a connecting link to 
its operational sign ' (Uexkiill 1 989: 1 5 1 ) .  

How reference - the index-driven circuit between the semio­
sphere (Lotman 1 984) and the biosphere - is managed by sign-users 
and sign-interpreters remains, despite the best efforts of Peirce and 
of his many followers, a profound enigma. Theories of mapping and 
modelling have not progressed beyond disciplined speculation .  
Notwithstanding that, I remain intuitively attracted to  Wheeler's 
( 1 988) closed loop of the world viewed as a self-synthesizing system 
of existences. His teacher, Niels Bohr, considered, rightly in my 
opinion ,  such questions as how concepts are related to reality as ul ti­
mately sterile.  Bohr once replied to this very question :  'We are sus­
pended in language in such a way that we cannot say what is up and 
what is down. The word reality is also a word, a word which we must 
learn to use correctly' (French and Kennedy 1 985:  302 ) .

Iconic Signs 

While indexicality clearly constitutes a fundamental form of sign­
ing, next in line is iconicity, the second of Peirce 's  three basic cate­
gories. In many ways, iconicity is a much more fundamental form 
of semiosis than is indexicality. In this chapter I will  look at the 
essential features, and at the multifarious manifestations, of this 
phenomenon. 

Iconicity 

As Wells ( 1 967) has judiciously pointed out, Peirce ' s  'notion of 
icon is as old as Plato 's  ( the sign imitates the signified) . '  It was 
indeed Plato who bequeathed the concept of mimesis (Lausberg 
1960: 554) to theoreticians of literature from Aristotle to Wimsatt 
( 1 954) , who was responsible for consciously restoring the term icon 
into the critical vocabulary at mid-century by using it as the key 
word in the title of one of his important collections of essays. How­
ever, the icon acquired its entirely novel perspective in conse­
quence of Peirce 's  juxtaposition in the very particular context of 
his second trichotomy of signs - the one he called his 'most funda-
mental ' (2 :275) division, and the one which has certainly become 

I his most influential - first with the index, and then both of the 
former pair with the symbol.\1'he icon and the index embody sign-
relations which are in the natural mode - respectively of likeness 
and of existential connection - as against the symbol, which is in 

l the conventional mode, or reflective of a relation that is character-



1 04 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

ized by ' an imputed quality,' to cite Peirce ' s  matchless precision of 
expression ( 1  :588) . 

Peirce 's  icon can scarcely be understood when wrenched out of 
the total context of his semiotic. And yet iconicity has generated a 
plethoric literature . Why has iconicity - and its complementary 
obverse aniconism ( the religious prohibition of images) - become 
the focus of so much passionate concern on the part of many? Wal­
lis ( 1 975: 1 57) , among others, has alluded to the suggestive power 
of iconic signs, and the implications of this puissance for the his­
tory of culture . The magic efficacy of the kind of icon called effigy 
has long been recognized in ritual experience , whether in a ser­
mon by Donne, when he proclaimed, in 1 661 , that ' in those that 
are damned before , we are damned in Effigie , '  or, in an appropri­
ate relic display of puppets in front of a fraternity house on virtu­
ally any American campus in season ,  in a ceremony to secure 
victory for one 's  football team. The ritual system of certain cul­
tures is constructed of iconic signs: thus, among the Rotinese , a 
major premise of rituals is based on the equation of humans and 
plants, and defined by icons cast in a life-enhancing botanic idiom 
(Fox 1 975: 1 1 3 ) . 

What does i t  mean to say that an iconic sign is based on ' similar­
ity, ' which Peirce introduced on occasion into his definiens? This 
was criticized by Eco ( 1 976: 192-200) as a naIve conception , be­
cause icons are culturally coded, that is, conventionally so ' in a 
more flexible sense . '  Of course , we know that Peirce had himself 
held exactly this view when he asserted that any material image ' is 
largely conventional in its mode of representation, '  although ' i t  
may b e  called a hypoicon' (2 :276) , and when he singled out ' icons 
in which the likeness is aided by conventional rules' (2 :279) . How­
ever this may be,  the usefulness of similarity, particularly in its 
classical juxtaposition with contiguity, as pointed out several times 
in previous chapters, derives from the pervasiveness of the pair in 
many fields of intellectual endeavour throughout Western history. 
Thus, while I welcome Eco 's  imaginative and searching analysis, I 
still favour retaining the terminology that troubles him : ' similari ty, ' 
and the rest, constitute ,  in my view, a time-honoured set of primes 
whose usefulness in a wide range of human sciences has been 



Iconic Signs 1 05 

amply proven, but whose pertinence to semiotic discourse 
becomes fully manifest only if properly applied.  The notion of an 

I icon is very much impoverished when viewed, as it so often is, in 
isolation rather than in the total context of a fully rounded science 
of signs. 

The Incidence of Iconicity 

There are numberless instances of iconicity in zoosemiotic dis­
course, involving virtually all known channels - that is, forms of 
physical energy propagation - available to animals for message 
transmission .  Bateson ( in Sebeok 1 968: 6 1 4-28) has even tried to 
explain why genotypic controls have often evolved to determine 
iconic signalling, and has brillian tly argued that an understanding 
of human dreaming ' should throw ligh t both on how iconic com­
munication operates among animals and on the mysterious evolu­
tionary step from the iconic to the verbal . '  The same startling 
thought, of the evolutionary immediacy of dreaming in humans 
that allows for a degree of consciousness during periods of sleep 
and hence a certain discontinuity of the subject! ohject distinction 
inherent  in iconic coding, seems to have occurred independently 
to Thom ( 1 975: 72f. ) . 

Just a few illustrations of the use of iconic signs in the animal 
world will suffice here .  The iconic function of a chemical sign may 
be accurately measured by fluctuations in the intensity of insect 
odour trails laid by successful foragers, for example ,  in various spe­
cies of an ts. The actual quantity of the emitted pheromone 
depends directly on the amount and quality of the source of nour­
ishment: ' as a food supply and the odor intensity of the trail to it 
diminish, fewer foragers are attracted '  (Butler 1 970:  45) ; that is, 
the pheromone acts as an iconic sign vehicle inasmuch as it relates 
in analog fashion to the waxing or waning of the guiding odour 
spots (although a crawling insect may use supplementary channels 
- redundantly or according to strict rules of code-switching - such 
as sight, touch , sun-compass reaction ,  and orien tation by polarized 
light from a blue sky, but always, under such conditions, in an 
iconic fashion) . Genetically programmed iconicity plays a pivotal 



1 06 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

role in deception involving smell and taste , colour and shape , 
sound, and, of course , behaviour, as graphically described by Hin­
ton ( 1 973) . Sometimes an animal even alters its surroundings to fit  
its own image by fabricating a number of dummy copies of itself to 
misdirect predators away from its body, the live model, to one of 
several replicas it constructs for that very purpose. And this is only 
one among a number of iconic antipredation devices contrived by 
different  species of a highly interesting genus of spiders known as 
orb-weavers (Wickler 1 968: 56f, Hinton 1 973: 1 25f. ) . The theory of 
mimicry, which finds many applications throughout both plan ts 
and animals, as Wickler ( 1 968) has shown, deals with a range of 
natural phenomena involving the origin of all species and all adap­
tations. However, associations consisting of models and their mim­
ics constitute but one special set of biological events connecting 
signs with things signified by 'a mere relation of reason ' (Peirce 
1 :372) , in which case the sign is an icon , so that the former must be 
integrated, in toto, with the far more general and deep theory of 
iconicity. 

I cannot resist recounting one particularly elegant (if sometimes 
disputed) example of a complex piece of invertebrate behaviour 
that evolved,  as it  were, to function as an iconic sign in the visual or 
tactile mode . Unravelled by Kloft ( 1 959 ) , it has to do with a certain 
ant-associated aphid species. These small, soft-bodied insects, very 
vulnerable to predator attack, are protected and tended by ants 
with which they communicate by an alarm pheromone that func­
tions to stabilize their association .  Their relationship is further 
reinforced by the fact that the ants ' milk' the aphids by vibrating 
their antennae against an aphid's back; the aphids then secrete 
droplets of honeydew which are consumed by the ants. Kloft real­
ized that this congenial relationship rests on a 'misunderstanding' 
and proposed, as a working hypothesis, that the hind end of an 
aphid 's  abdomen , and the kicking of its hind legs, constitute , for 
an an t worker, a compound sign vehicle, signifying, from its per­
spective , the head of another ant together with its antennal move­
ment. In other words, the ant, in an act of perversion of the 
normal trophallaxis occurring between sisters, identifies the rep­
lica ( the rear end of the aphid) with the model ( the front end of 



Iconic Signs 1 07 

the ant) and solicits on the basis of this misinformation , treating a 
set  of vital biological releasers out of context, that is, in the manner 
of an effigy. The multiple resemblances between model and rep­
lica are so striking, subtle , and precisely effective that they can 
hardly be explained away as an evolutionary coincidence (Wilson 
1 975: 422) . 

Features of Iconicity 

I have already cited in previous chapters Peirce's  rough division of 
icons into images, diagrams, and metaphors (2 :227) , and men­
tioned his seeming lack of interest in the third. Icons are still too 
often simplistically identified with mere images, such equations 
giving rise to shallow and unenlightening theories, especially of 
art . The neglect of diagrams is particularly incomprehensible in 
view of the fact that they loomed large in Peirce 's  own semiotic 
research , and that they have been reviewed by at least three careful 
scholars,  at some length (Zeman 1 964, Roberts 1 973,  Thibaud 
1 975) . 

Peirce (2 :282) has explicitly spelled out that 'many diagrams 
resemble their objects not at all in looks; i t  is only in respect to the 
relations of their parts that their likeness consists . ' Elsewhere ,  he 
stressed that 'a  diagram has got to be either auditory or visual , the 
parts being separated in one case in time ,  in the other in space'  
(3 :41 8) . There follows a crucial passage (3 :41 9) , which all  linguists 
should read through to the end. Peirce established there , among 
other things, that ' language is but a kind of algebra, ' or method of 
forming a diagram . He then continues: 'The meanings of words 
ordinarily depend upon our tendencies to weld together qualities 
and our aptitudes to see resemblances, or, to use the received 
phrase , upon associations by similarity; while experience is bound 
together, and only recognizable , by forces acting upon us, or, to 
use an even worse chosen technical term, by means of associations 
of contiguity. ' He dwells upon (7:467) ' the living influence upon us 
of a diagram, or icon, with whose several parts are connected in 
thought an equal number of feelings or ideas . . .  But the icon is not 
always clearly apprehended. We may not know at all what it is; or 



1 08 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

we may have learned it by observation of nature . '  To put it  tersely, I 
am of the opinion that no critique of iconcity that ignores Peirce 's 
existential graphs in their multifarious implications can be taken 
seriously or regarded as at all viable .  

A surprisingly prevalent solecism assumes that icons, that is ,  
images, are necessarily confined to the visual modality. Sometimes 
a semantic constriction of this sort is imposed by deliberate choice . 
ffhere is substantial agreement, '  according to one outstanding 
experimenter searching for the locus of short-term visual storage , 
also called iconic memory, ' that the terms icon , visual image , and 
persistence of sensation may be used interchangeably' (Sakitt 
1 975 :  1 3 1 9) . \But a moment's reflection about the iconic compo­
nents of spOken natural language should suffice to check th is 
counter-productive terminological limitatio.!!J We ought also to be 
mindful, in this connection, of the many multi-sensory iconic rep­
resentations that pervade human and other animal existence in  
everyday life .  One such sphere which is permeated by iconicity i s ,  
broadly speaking, that of  small-group ecology, illustrated, for 
instance, by seating behaviour (Lott and Sommer 1 967) as one 
kind of spatial positioning: at a family gathering, we expect to find 
the 'head'  of the household at the ' head '  of the table , etc .  As stud­
ies of various alloprimates have likewise clearly shown, ' the relative 
position and distance of the various members of a group from one 
another reflect the nature of the social relations between them'  
(Hall and DeVore 1 965: 70) . Moreover, Kummer ( 1 97 1 :  233) has 
insightfully reviewed the essentially iconic connection of social 
relations and spatial arrangements in animals in general , plausibly 
concluding with the suggestion that ' territorial tendencies . . .  can 
reemerge in the handling of information . '  In other words, there 
exists a diagrammatic correspondence between the signans, the 
spatial arrangement, and the signatum, the social organization , in a 
fashion analogous to the isomorphic relation between a geograph­
ical area and any map that purports to represent  it . 

Contemplation of the icon sooner or later tends to turn from 
legitimately semiotic concerns, in the technical sense , to intracta­
ble, indeed mind-boggling, philosophical problems of identity, 



Iconic Signs 1 09 

analogy, resemblance, and contrast (Ayer 1 968: 1 5 1 ) ,  similarity and 
dissimilarity, arbitrariness and motivation, geometry and topology, 
nature and culture, space and time, life and death .  The experience 
is like entering a fun house furnished with specular reflections and 
distorting mirrors, doubles and replicas, emphatic stimuli and 
superoptimal models, and being taken for a ride in the clair­
obscure on one of Gombrich 's  ( 1 95 1 )  pedigreed hobby-horses. 
Eco ( 1 976: 2 1 2) ,  with his customary stylish wit, has provided his 
readers with some guideposts through this jungle of equivocations, 
not ignoring the final ,  possibly fatal, ambiguity that ' everything 
resembles everything else . '  To answer his animadversions upon the 
icon , recall my example in the third chapter vis-a-vis the issue of 
regression ( the representation of La Gioconda) . 

The essential features of iconicity can be summarized as follows 
(see also Bouissac et al . 1 986) : 

• The notion of icon, and allied concepts, have come under con­
tinuous and, at certain periods, quite intense discussion through­
out the centuries linking Plato and Peirce. The tendency of ideas 
to consort with one another because of similarity became a pow­
erful principle for explaining many mental operations, and thus 
an important chapter in the history of ideas, where the story was, 
as it still is, retold with infinite variations. 

• Peirce's  ( 1 : 3 1 3, 383, 502) ' resemblance-association , '  out of which 
his icon must have crystallized, derives its startling novelty from 
being embedded in a progressively more complex, profound, 
and productive semiotic matrix, which is ,  moreover, conceived as 
both a theory of communication and a theory of signification . 
Although Peirce 's  classification of signs has become the one con­
stant lodestar in debates about iconicity since 1 867,  the level of 
discussion is substantially diminished when the icon is, as is often 
done, quarantined from the total context of his unique brand of 
the ' doctrine'  of signs, or when the in tricacies of his semiotic are 
insufficiently grasped (having perhaps been culled from second­
ary sources, or worse) . 



1 10 Signs: An In troduction to Semiotics 

• There are no pure iconic signs; in fact, ' no actual sign is an icon ' 
(Ayer 1 968 : 1 40) . The transformation of deiconization is fre­
quent; the reverse process of iconization more seldom encoun­
tered. It is plausible to assume that there may be a diachronic 
tendency toward an equilibrium in mixed systems of signs (such 
as gesture-languages used in some deaf communities) . 

• Iconicity plays a decisive role in shaping everyday life in all cul­
tures.  Iconic signs suffuse humanity's communication codes, ver­
bal no less than non-verbal . 

• Iconic signs are found throughout the phylogenetic series, in all 
modali ties as circumscribed by the sense organs by which mem­
bers of a given species are able to inform themselves about their  
environment. Signal forgery ( i . e . ,  the phenomenon of mim­
icry) , in fact, all deceptive manoeuvring by plants ,  animals,  a s  
well as humans, often crucially depends on iconicity. 

• Unsolved riddles concerning this pervasive mode of produci ng, 
storing, and transmitting iconic sign tokens abound. Some of 
these pertain to logic, some to psycho-physiology, others to ethol­
ogy. Their solution awaits the advent  of new analytical tools, the 
most promising among which by far - for it sh ows how the pro­
cess of copying operates throughout the molecular level ,  governs 
perception ,  imbues the communicative systems of animals as well 
as of humans, and constitutes a fundamen tal principle of sociobi­
ology, in brief, is capable of in tegrating globally far-reaching 
problems of a universal character involving mutual dynamic rela­
tions between signifier and signified (Thorn 1 974: 245) - are 
likely to come from catastrophe theory (e .g . , Stewart 1 975) , 
which will render them susceptible to topological analysis. 

The Study of Iconicity 

Around the turn of the last century, labouring en tirely outside the 
grand philosophical currents that culminated in Peirce's  semiotic ,  
h is  con temporary, Ferdinand de Saussure , con tributed to  the 



Iconic Signs 1 1 1  

progress of the field with much more modest restraint, both 
departing from a stric tly linguistic base and making constant refer­
ence back to linguistic standards, but wholly with a view to the 
future . Although Saussure never used the term , he did provide, as 
a passing example of an iconic sign , the scales of justice (Saussure 
1 967 [ 1 9 1 6] )  representing the equilibrium between sin and pun­
ishment.  The actual provenance of his ideas about the typology of 
signs remains a tan talizing mystery. He appeared to have evinced 
no special interest in iconicity, and although his Franco-Swiss suc­
cessor, Bally ( 1 939) , did so to a limited extent, our common fund 
of knowledge about the theory of signs and symbols has not been 
materially enhanced in the Saussurean tradition .  Yet the break-

. through in the field did ul timately originate in France,  to wit, in 
: Thorn 's  ( 1 973) brillian t foray into this aspect of semiotics. I t  
. should surprise no one that Peirce 's ideas, particularly about the 

icon ,  should have found so sympathetic an echo in the work of this 
distinguished creator of topological models, for Peirce expected 
his existential graphs to also explicitly contribute toward an under­
standing of topological laws (4 :428f. ) ; indeed, his ' system is topo-

.I  logical throughout' (Gardner 1968:  56) . 
Thorn ( 1 975: 72f. )  assumes that the principal role of the central 

nervous system of animals is to map out local ized regions to simu­
late the position of the organism in its environment,  as well as to 

I represent objects, such as prey and predator, that are biologically 
. 

and/or socially crucial with respect to its survival or well-being. 
I That is to say, an animal is constantly informed and impelled by 

meaning-bearing sign vehicles designed to release pertinent motor 
reflexes ( irms) , such as approach ( say, toward a prey) or with­
drawal ( say, from a predator) , or surrogate verbal responses in the 
human , as in a transitive subject-verb-object sen tence , a syntactic 

, pattern which can be viewed as a temporal transcription of a bio­
logical event in space-time , predation , as its archetypal paradigm . 
Among animal behaviourists, Schneirla ( 1 965: 2) has argued per­
suasively, in support of his biphasic theory, that 'operations which 
appropriately increase or decrease distance between organisms 
and stimulus sources must have been crucial for the survival of all 
animal types' in the evolution of behaviour. Thorn ( 1 975: 73) has 



1 1 2 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

extended this line of reasoning to humans, who, he says, by the act 
of naming have replaced iconic representations of space-time 
interactions with symbols. 

The genesis of icons was sketched, all too briefly, by Thom 
( 1 973) . In countless instances, images appear naturally, but copies 
of this sort are ordinarily devoid of semiotic value - a person ' s 
shadow cast upon the ground, a shape reflected in water, a foot 
imprinted in sand. Such everyday spatial images are necessarily 
endowed with certain physical , geometric properties, but they 
attain semiotic status only under special circumstances. For a 
shadow to be cast, as in the first example, the model must be illu­
minated by a luminous source , the light hitting the body, thus 
defining its shadow. In the second example , a specular image is 
similarly formed in the reflecting surface .  In neither example is 
the resulting image permanent: it is bound to vanish with the dis­
appearance of the model (or luminous source) .  However, the third 
example illustrates a new phenomenon that Thom calls 'plasticity' 
of the receptor system. The footprint does not necessarily decay 
when the foot is withdrawn (or the sun goes under) : the formative 
stimulus alters the equilibrium of the receptor system when 
impressing the shape of the model; here the image becomes a 
memory trace (Sakitt 1 975) . Thom designates the dynamic state 
involved in such a transaction ' competence , '  implying the possibil­
ity of irreversible temporal interaction . A modification in the first 
example underlines the distinction: should a person's  shadow be 
cast upon a photographic plate instead of the unsensitized ground, 
that person 's image may forever be fixed owing to the competence 
of the receptor system. Using the concepts suggested, one can 
envisage the formation of images equistable with their models, or 
more so, as termite mound constructions faithfully display in ,  so to 
speak, 'frozen , '  or fossilized, products the social behaviour of these 
great insect architects ,  becoming available for a study of their 
behavioural evolution long after the extinction of the colony itself 
(Emerson 1 938) . 

At this stage it can be claimed that life has been attained.  
A living being L fabricates, at some temporal remove , another 
living being '

L , isomorphic with L. L' will soon supplan t L. Th ol11 
claims that his feature of plasticity activates the genetic code , 



Iconic Signs 1 1 3 

gIVIng rise to a self-replicating, mutable molecular system that is 
also environment-sensitive . The process involved is foreshadowed 
by the kind of inorganic local explosion that occurs in photo­
graphic emulsification. It becomes particularly plain in embryolog­
ical development, which may be among the most dramatic forms 
of iconization : it is nature 's design for unfolding the growth and 
differentiation of a structure isomorphic with the parent by virtue 
of a spatial-temporal translating operation.  On the molecular level,  
this same mechanism is realized when the DNA double helix is rep­
licated to generate two helices, each containing one old strand and 
one newly made one. 

At the other end of the ontogenetic ladder of life ,  Thom invites 
us to consider the phenomenon of perception : this can be 
regarded as a modification of dynamic competence by the sensory 
impact of external reality, very much as Socrates had instructed 
Theaetetus. Any competent system,  for example , the mechanical 
and hydrodynamic components of cochlear partition and the 
acoustic cortex, or the retina and the visual cortex, e tc . ,  rapidly 
recovers its percipient virginity, indispensahle for total and perma­
nent competence, while i ts plastic facul ty guaran tees that the sense 
impressions remain stored in the memory. 

In Thom's panoramic conspectus, the formation of icons appears 
throughout the entire scale of nature as a manifestation of a univer­
sal dynamic of irreversible character: a model ramifies in to a repli­
ca isomorphic wi th it. Frequently, however, this process employs 
a reversible interaction, due to the perennial oscillation of the 
thermodynamics between a Hamiltonian conservative viewpoint 
(expressed in the First Law) and the Heracli tean viewpoint,  ' time 's  
arrow' (expressed in the Second Law) . In all interactions between 
the two indispensable moieties of the sign , the relation of signified 
to signifier must obey this universal flux: the signified engenders the 
signifier in an eternal process of branching. But the signifier re­
engenders the signified each time that we interpre t the sign . In bio­
logical terms, th is is to say that the descendant as signifier can 
become the parent  as signified , given the lapse of one generation . 

Thom has vastly more to say, albeit in hrief compass, about the 
image which bears on deiconization , stylization , decomposition, 
aging, and death ,  drawing a far-reaching distinction between the 



1 1 4 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

physical capacity of an icon to resist the noise factor inherent in any 
communicative exchange , and its biological capacity to evoke other 
forms biologically or sociologically important or ' interesting. ' 

Seeking common cause with Peirce, Thom probes the heart of 
signification .  The transcendent feature of both is a soaring imagi­
nation . Their shared scientific instrument for the invention and 
discovery of new truths, as well as their device for reordering old 
ones, is a branch of mathematics capable of dealing with discontin­
uous and divergent  phenomena, a special part of the theory of sin­
gularities. These two figures of charismatic depth bracket a 
cen tury of more or less pedestrian divagations about the sign, as 
well as occasionally inspired extensions and applications of semi­
otic notions over most parts of the verbal and nonverbal domains. 

fThe genetic code , the metabolic code (hormone-mediated inter­
cellular transactions) , the nonverbal communicative codes used in 
a very high number of organisms including humans, our unique 
verbal code and i ts differentiated participation in all manner of 
artistic functions, whether li terary, musical ,  pictorial , architecturaT, 
choreographic, theatrical , filmic, or of diverse hybrid formations, 
and finally, comparisons among any of the aforementioned - these 
all continue to be on the agenda of contemporary semiotic science . 
Peirce and Thom cast a biunique spell that enthrals us, and i t  
would be  instructive to inquire sometime into the source of this fas­
cination .  The catastrophe theory developed by Thom in the 1 960s 
was aimed first at embryology, where it  could , in principle , account  
for each point of  bifurcation as the development of  a cell diverges 
froIll that of its immediate neighbours. Later, Thom extended his 
theory to evolution in general , reproduction, thinking, and, last 
but not least, the generation and transmission of verbal and non­
verbal signs. I t  so happens that images are a major feature of his 
theory; he has proved that, despite the almost limitless number of 
discontinuous phenomena that can exist, there are only a certain 
number of different images that actually occur. He called these 
' elementary catastrophes, ' and has shown that, in a space having no 
more than four dimensions (such as our ' real ' world) ,  there are 
exactly seven such transformations.

Fetish Signs 

As everyone can ascertain from the Oxford English Dictionary, the 
English vocable fetish was directly adopted from the Portuguese 
substantive feitifo, ' charm, sorcery' (Spanish hechizo; both from the 
Latin facticius, ' factitious , '  meaning 'artificial , skilfully contrived ' ) .  
Originally, the term was applied to any of the objects used by the 
people of the Guinea coast and neighbouring regions as talismans, 
amulets, or other means of enchantment, 'or regarded by them 
with superstitious dread . '  Portuguese sailors allegedly minted the 
appellation in the fifteenth century when they observed the vener­
ation that West Coast Mricans had for such objects, which they 
wore on their person (see also Herskovits 1 947: 368) . The earliest 
English citation , as further reported in the OED, dates from a 1 6 1 3  
work by Purchas, Pilgrimage (6 . 1 5 . 65 1 ) :  ' Hereon were set many stra­
wen Rings called fatissos or Gods. ' 

Writers on anthropology, following Brosses ( 1 760) , began using 
fetish in the wider sense of an inanimate object being worshipped by 
' savages' on account of i ts supposed inherent magical powers, or as 
i ts animation by a spiri t. More generally still ,  fetish referred to some­
thing irrationally reverenced. In 1 869 McLennan , who framed 
totemism as a theoretical topic, also invented the notorious for­
mula: totemism is fetishism plus exogamy and matrilineal descent  
(but see Levi-Strauss 1 962: 1 8) .  Van Wing then wrote ( 1 938: 1 3 1 )  an 
oft-cited amplification about the fetish as a metaphor/me tonym 
opposition.  

The purpose of this chapter is to look at fetish as an example of 
semiosis that overlaps several sign categories. Although fetishism is 



1 1 6 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

common among mammals, it is a particularly good example of the 
fecundity of human semiosis involving the body, the mind, and cul­
ture simultaneously. 

The Origin of Fetishism as 'Deviation' 

One fruitful way of classifying religions has been to ask in the case 
of each : where is the divine ( the object of religious responses) pri­
marily sought and located, and what sort of response is primarily 
made to it? According to this principle of division , religions may be 
partitioned into three major groups: sacramental , prophetic, and 
mystical . Details of this were spelled out by Alston ( 1 967b) , follow­
ing a suggestion by William James; but Auguste Comte and Charles 
de Brosses specifically interpreted the fetish as a basis for their 
theories concerning the origin of religion .  

The divine in  the sacramental religion i s  said to be  chiefly 
sought in things, which are thought of as capable of capturing nat­
ural forces - inanimate things, such as pieces of wood, relics ot 
saints, statues,  crosses; or food and drink, such as bread and wine 
or baptismal water; or living things, such as the totemic animal of 
the group, the sacred cow, the sacred tree;  or processes, such as the 
movements of the sacred dance. In very primitive forms of sacra­
mental religion, when the object itself, perhaps possessing animate 
existence in and of itself, is responded to as divine,  that object has, 
in early anthropological practice , been designated a fetish . Such a 
fetish could be wrought to have positive effects - such as to heal or 
cure sickness - and even used to induce erotic disposition , that is, 
to affect and alter ' natural ' social relations. 

Clearly, it was the assignment of the latter capability that led to 
the eventual espousal of the term in clinical ,  and thence in legal ,  
discourse to describe the enhancement of sexual activity in the 
presence of a type of object which is, for others, not at all , or if 
so but weakly, endowed with a compulsively sexual (paraphiliac) 
connotation.  Gebhard ( 1 969: 72) quite properly envisions ' the 
whole matter of fetishism as a graduated phenomenon. At one end 
of the range is slight preference; next is strong preference; next is 
the point where the fetish item is a necessity to sexual activity; and 



Fetish Signs 1 1 7 

at the terminal end of the range the fetish i tem substitutes for a liv­
ing sexual partner. ' Indeed, as will become clear, sorting by degree 
is the only procedure that makes sense when the matter is viewed 
from the semiotic standpoint. 

The notion of 'fetishism of the commodities' (Erckenbrecht 
1 976) has become one of the cardinal concepts and slogans of the 
Marxist heri tage as applied to the analysis of the relationship 
between people and products, or between use-value and exchange­
value . Geras ( 1 97 1 :  7 1 ) sees the origins of this concept in the more 
fundamental distinction between 'essence ' ( i .e . ,  ' real '  social rela­
tions) and ' appearance ' ( the outer manifestation of such rela­
tions) . He writes ' I t  is because there exists at the interior of 
capitalist society, a kind of internal rupture between the social rela­
tions which obtain and the manner in which they are experienced, 
that the scientist of the society is confronted with the necessity of 
constructing reality against appearances. Thus this necessity can 
no longer be regarded as an arbitrary importation into Marx's own 
theoretical equipment or something he merely extracted from 
other pre-existing sciences . . .  [It is] seen to lead, by a short route , 
to the heart of the notion of fetishism . '  

I n  short, to invest a commodity with powers which are not 
present or inherent is to elevate i t  to the status of a fetish ; it  is in 
this way that money, or capital in general , comes to be ' fe tishized . '  
Jhally ( 1 987: 29 )  - whose concern i s  wi th fetishism in  television 
and magazine advertising - recently reformulated this process in 
quasi-semiotic parlance when commenting that ' fetishism consists 
of seeing the meaning of things as an inherent part of their physi­
cal existence when in fact that meaning is created by their integra­
tion in to a system of meaning. ' Earlier, Baudrillard ( 1 981 : 92)  
made a similar point when he noted that it is the sanctification of 
the system as such , ' the commodity as system, '  that reinforces ' the 
fetishist fascination . '  

The Fetish in Psychology and Sexology 

Psychopathia sexualis ( 1 886) ,  by the forensic psychiatrist Richard 
von Krafft-Ebing, contained the first systematic collection of data 



1 1 8 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

relating to ' pathological ' fetishism. This text, wi th its view of sex as 
perverted and disgusting, came to exert a great, baleful , and seem­
ingly perpetual influence . He wrote extensively of sex crimes and 
sexual variations or deviations, which he considered based upon 
genetic defects .  

As far as I have been able to trace , it  was Krafft-Ebing who first 
referred to the notion of the fetish as a ' perversion , '  that is, some­
th ing that required shame and social sanctions to control i t. 
According to his descriptions, a fetish was a non-human object -
a part of the body or something contiguous to it, such as cloth­
ing - which served as an impetus to sexual arousal and orgasm. 
The Teutonic doctor, in fact, considered all acts other than mari tal 
coitus for the purpose of procreation , and all surrogates for 
penile/vaginal intercourse - for example , voyeurism, exhibi tion­
ism, transvestitism , sadomasochism - as 'perversions' to be repre­
hended. 

Krafft-Ebing's 'method' is illustrated by his report of a case (no . 
1 0 1 )  of hair-fetishism, which I cite from Kunzle ( 1 982: 53) , who -
after the French police doctor Paul Garnier 's monograph ( 1 896: 
70) - uses it to illustrate ' the degree of moral vindictiveness ' evinced 
by the authorities and approved of by Krafft-Ebing. According to 
this retold story, a seventeen-year-old boy was watching a show in the 
Tuileries gardens, while pressing up to a girl 'whose hair he silen tly, 
amorously rolled between his fingers, so softly that she did not even 
notice . Suddenly two plainclothes policemen sprang upon him. 
One seized with his hand the boy's erect penis through his trousers , 
and cried "A t last we got you . . .  after all the time we 've been watchingyoll!" 
The boy was then sentenced to th ree months in jail. 

A standard comprehensive textbook of psychiatry by Freedman , 
Kaplan , and Sadock ( 1 972) likewise defines the use of fetishes ( in 
an explici tly sexual context) in metonymic terms: The process of 
achieving sexual excitement and gratification by substi tuting an 
inanimate object such as a shoe,  piece of underwear, or other arti­
cle of clothing for a human love object. ' This definition is substan­
tially repeated under the rubric of 'Other Sexual Deviations' [ sir] , 
where only ' a  foot or a lock of hair' is added to the enumeration of 
common sexual fetishes. (A recent conspicuous instance of foot  



Fetish Signs 1 1 9 

fetishism is displayed in Martin Scorsese 's short film Life Lessons; 
this is realized by his camera's - or the painter's - obsessive dwell­
ing over Rosanna Arquette 's feet. )  In point  of fact, it is very com­
mon in psychiatric literature to find references to the attraction a 
patient  may have for an inanimate object as ' inordinate ' or ' patho­
logical . '  

A recent exchange (6  March 1 987) from 'The Kinsey Report, ' a 
syndicated newspaper column by my colleague June Reinisch , epit­
omizes the current  scientific view of the subject: 

Q. - I am a male in my mid-20s. Since age 9 ,  I have been strongly 
attracted to women 's feet, shoes and stockings. I become sexu­
ally aroused thinking about foot odor and sometimes have erec­
tions in public places from fantasizing about this. I feel 
extremely guilty and think most people would think I ' m  per­
verted. Do you think I ' m  sick? Do I need professional help? Why 
am I this way? 

A. - I think that you should consult a psychotherapist who is 
experienced in working with sexual problems. He or she can 
help you determine exactly what role these desires play in your 
life ,  and then the two of you can decide what type of therapy (if 
any) is necessary for you to form long-lasting, close relation­
ships. Fetishism is a behavior in which sexual arousal depends 
on an inanimate object, a certain body part or the like - in short, 
on something other than the whole person . This area has not 
been fully examined scientifically. Very li ttle is known about the 
causes of fe tish istic behavior, except that it is thought to origi­
nate early during psychosocial development. Scientists also 
don ' t  know how many people have sexual fetishes but it is clear 
that this behavior is much more common in men than in 
women.  A variety of body parts ,  i tems of clothing and odors have 
been mentioned in reports of individual fetishism.  

It  i s  clear first of  all that both parties in the exchange view the 
reported fetishistic comportment as constituting a sexual ' prob­
lem , '  possibly even a 'perverte d '  form of behaviour, or one at least 



1 20 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

likely to require psychotherapeutic intervention . This is so in spi te 
of Reinisch 's  concession that very little is known about the causa­
tion or ontogeny of the kind of behaviour described. 

Reinisch also echoes an opinion common among clinicians -
that fetishism is much more common in men than in women .  This 
presumption was held by Freud ( 1 927;  see Vigener 1 989) as well  as 
by Kinsey ( 1 953:  679) and his collaborators who considered fetish­
ism to be an ' almost exclusively male phenomenon . '  Freud and his 
epigones even held that fetishism is the male perversion par excel­
lence. Schor ( 1 985: 303) put it in a nutshell :  ' female fetishism is in 
the rhetoric of psychoanalysis, an oxymoron . '  

For Schor 's subject, George Sand, the female fetish happens to 
be a wound; but wounds, Schor ( 1 985: 304) asserts ,  ' are not gener­
ally fetishized by men ' - a questionable claim. Fetishistic attraction 
to cripples - or more broadly to 'discredited'  individuals who bear 
stigmata in Goffman 's sense ( 1 963) , as also to one-legged females ,  
and even crutch fetishism (Schindler 1 953) - abounds in  the liter­
ature . For instance Morris ( 1 969: 1 70) reports the following case: a 
young boy 'was leaning out of a window when his first ejaculation 
occurred.  As it happened, he saw a figure moving past in the road 
outside,  walking on crutches. When he was married he could only 
make love to his wife if she wore crutches in bed. ' 

Reinisch implicitly subscribes to the view of the fetish as an 
essentially indexical sign - especially a synecdochical sign ( ' some­
thing other than than the whole person ' )  - although, of course , 
her idiom is other than semiotic. Indeed the fetish is, as here, com­
monly regarded as a fixation on the pars pro toto. 

The most extensive recent study of the fetish in sexology is to be 
found in John Money's Lovemaps ( 1 986) . He once more offers a 
conventional definition : ' an object or charm endowed with magi­
cal or supernatural power; an object or part of the body charged,  
for a particular person,  with special sexuoerotic power' ( 1 986: 
261 ) .  In his lemma on 'fetishism , '  however, there is a hint of a 
wider view ( to which I shall return ) when Money ( 1 986: 265 ) 
points out that there ' is no technical term for the reciprocal 
paraphiliac condition in which the fetish , for example , a uniform , 
must belong to the self. ' 



Fetish Signs 1 2 1 

Mainly, what we find in Money's book is a routine catalogue of 
some objects that have been pinpoin ted by numerous clinicians as 
typical fetishes. Pornographers fabricate and sell objects - includ­
ing pictorial and written displays - arranged according to similar 
categories, designed to cater to every conceivable fetish istic taste . 

Money classifies ( 1 986: 65f. ) tangible objects - or, technically, 
imagery - in addition to those appealing to the eye , as either haptic 
or olfactory, available in immediate perception or in fantasy. The 
former pertain to feelings of pressure , rubbing, or touch , which 
may be generated internally (as by an enema or other inserted arte-

I fact) or externally (by the application of fabrics, fur, hair, etc . ) .  A 
. 

tactual token may also be a live creature, wriggling and/ or furry; 
thus, in one reported case , a woman habitually placed a dog in her 
crotch , 'as an adjunct to masturbation and orgasm , '  but she later 
substi tuted a small infant in the same position ( 1 986: 64) . 

Leather (e .g . ,  shoes) and rubber or plastic (e .g. , training pants) 
, fetishes bridge the gap between touch and smell ,  as did James 

Joyce's fetish for soiled knickers (Wilson 1 989) . Olfactory fetishes 
characteristically carry the smell of some portion of the human 
body, especially of those garments that cover sexual parts (fecal or 
urinary odour, odour of sweat, menstrual odour, smell of lacta­
tion ) .  These garments are sometimes also sucked or chewed. 

Although Money does not emphasize this, the use of fetishes by 
females seems considerably more prevalent than has been explic­
itly recognized in the literature thus far. Freud's judgment was 
obviously dictated by his theoretical preoccupation with the castra­
tion complex, according to which fixation or regression to prior 
psycho-sexual stages of development underlies deviations, so that 
castration anxiety is the central component of fetishism. 

Kinsey's traditional supporting opinion may have been due to 
nothing more that a prejudicial sampling error. For instance , com­
pulsive stealing of objects which are of no intrinsic value to the 
thief but which have obsessive semiotic significance - treated in 
sexology under the heading of 'kleptophilia' - seemingly does 
occur in women more often than in men, but the connection is 
not always explicitly recognized (see Zavitzianos 1 97 1 , relating 
female fe tishism to exhibitionism and kleptomania) . 



1 22 Signs:  An In troduct ion to Semiotics 

Moreover, reports l ike the following are not uncommon : 'A 
young girl experienced her first  orgasm when clutching a piece of 
black velve t as she masturbated.  As an adult, velvet became essen­
tial to her sexually. Her whole house was decorated wi th it and she 
only married in order to obtain more money to buy more velvet '  
(Morris 1 969: 1 69) . Similarly, the fixation of Imelda Marcos on her 
500 bras and 2 ,700 pairs of shoes appears to be a well-publicized 
case of something more than run-of-the-mill female fetishism. 

Children  of both sexes frequen tly cling to an object  - a la Linus 
and his celebrated blanke t. Such an o�ject may be related by conti­
guity to a parent  or to the infan t's early material surroundings. 
According to some psychiatris ts (Freedman et al . 1 972:  637) , th is 
' is a securi ty operation that should be distinguished from fetish ism 
in which the normal sexual object is substi tuted by another. '  I t  i s  
further asserted in  th is source that fetishism of  this latter type ' is  
not  known to occur in childhood. '  However, this judgment  may be 
due to psychiatrists' clinging to the prejudice that a fetish , in order 
to be defined as such , must produce geni tal sexual satisfaction 
(usually deemed ' devian t'  as well ) , and that the use of objects to 
produce a fe tishistic effect  necessarily occurs relatively late in ado­
lescence . Nevertheless,  transitory objects present  in the ch ild 's  
immediate environment  earl ier on may, even tually, be promoted 
to the status of a full fe tish , and so th is again seems to be only a 
matter of degree (Sperling 1 963,  Roiphe 1 973,  Bemporad e t  al . 
1 976) . 

In passing, a syndrome sometimes called ' Pygmalionism , '  wh ich 
refers to a fe tish in the shape of a female statue or life-sized rubber 
doll, should be mentioned here .  From a semiotic viewpoint ,  such 
an object would constitute an index strongly tinged wi th iconicity. 
(To a lesser degree ,  the rarer cases of tattoo fetishism , as reported 
by Weimann 1 962 , may involve iconic indexes, too . )  

Still o ther fetishes - as for instance diamond engagemen t rings, 
gold wedding bands, and class rings or pins exchanged as tokens of 
going steady by teenagers ( Money 1 986: 63) - can be taken as 
indexes overlaid,  in an erotic frame of reference, wi th a pervasive 
symbolic sign ificance that is widely understood wi thin a culture . 
Money i tself, or, more broadly, property, is commonly reported to 



Fetish Signs 1 23 

turn into capitalistic fetish objects (Becker and Schorsch 1 975 and 
Stratton 1 987) . 

The Fetish in Semiotics 

I turn now to a fuller consideration of the fetish as a semiotic prob­
lem.  As can be gleaned even from the discussion thus far, it is clear 
that a fetish is 

• a sign , namely, that it is 

• a predominantly indexical sign ; and that, moreover, it is 

• an indexical sign of the metonymic species, usually a pars pro toto 
synecdoche;  and that 

• this indexical sign is, as a rule, intermingled with both iconic 
and symbolic elements in various proportions, depending on 
the context of i ts use . 

With respect to the last point, an important  consequence of the 
semiotic model of the fetish is that i t  is not  necessary for the repre­

r sen ted object to be fully present to the organism before informa­
tion about it can influence internal semiosis ( , thought' ) and 
induce what Peirce (7 :372) called 'gratific '  action . 

In another terminology, a fetish could be regarded as a model 
( aliquirI) , but such that this simulacrum is often more potent than 
the object ( aliquo) that it stands for ( stat pro) . I ts reference ( renvoi) 
is, as it were , reminiscent in efficacy to that of a caricature to the 
subject that it represents. This accords with Morris's ( 1 969 :  209 ) 
view that the art of caricature is entirely concerned with the pro­
cess of stimulus extremism . Features exaggerated in caricatures 
are , as a rule,  supernormal equivalents of normal juvenile features 
or of sexual parts , such as female breasts and buttocks. 

As we have seen , the term ' fetish ' has hitherto been principally 
employed in the fields of anthropology and psychiatry ( including 
especially psychoanalysis) and, in a narrower, more focused sense -



1 24 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

yet quite extensively - in studies of erotic and sexual behaviour in 
humans. The notion of 'fetish ' has to do, in all these conceptions, 
with an obsessive maintenance of self-image . 

To my knowledge , thus far only Christian Metz ( 1 985) has 
reflected on the 'fetish ' in chiefly semiotic terms, but even he has 
done so only in a strictly circumscribed technical environment, 
namely, in relation to photography. Metz feels that because of two 
features - relatively small size and the possibil ity of a look that may 
linger - a photograph , as opposed to the cinematic lexis, is better 
fit, or more likely, to work as a fetish , that is to say, as something 
that signifies both loss (Freudian ' symbolic castration , '  which is 
metaphoric) and protection against loss (which is metonymic) .  
However, let me here set aside the matter of the photograph-as­
fetish , which Metz then ingeniously relates to death (or the fear of 
death)  and conversation (embodied as looking, glancing, gazing) .  
Instead, I would prefer briefly to review and ponder the implica­
tions of the more relevant e thological problem variously dealt  with 
under such headings as the ' supernormal signal/stimulus' or the 
' superoptimal sign . '  

The point I want to make about such signs was neatly captured 
by Oscar Wilde's  celebrated aphorism (from A Woman of No Impor­
tance, act 3) , 'Nothing succeeds likes excess , '  i tself anticipated by 
Shakespeare 's lines 'To gild refined gold, to paint the lily, / To 
throw perfume on the violet . . .  / Is wasteful and ridiculous excess ' 
(KingJohn, 4.2 . 1 l f. ) . 

In short, a sign is deemed ' supernormal '  when it surpasse� a 
'normal '  sign in its effectiveness as a releaser (meaning, the dis­
charge of appropriate behaviour) . According to Guthrie's  ( 1 976: 
1 9 )  excellent account of the anatomy of social organs and behav­
iour, so-called supernormal signs 'occur in the form of extra-large 
social organs, i . e . ,  increasing signal strength by increasing signal 
amplitude. '  Thus, in certain species of animals, antlers and horns 
are used as an estimation of rank; they therefore either 'grow to 
gigantic size among the older males, or develop specialized modifi­
cations, like filling in between the tines to form palms, thereby 
increasing the visual effect from a distance . '  

I n  particular, anal and genital organs - or just those about which 



Fetish Signs 1 25 

mankind habours so many taboos - tend to become modified into 
semiotic organs for several reasons: in part, because mammals, hav­
ing, in general ,  a well-developed smelling apparatus, tend to use 
faeces and urine as part of their signing behaviour ( 'who was 
where and when? ' ) ; and,  in part, because of the sexual overtones 
of different mammalian ways of urination. Genitalia have fre­
quently acquired heavy semiotic import and have become ritual-

, ized into a set of signs conveying oppositions such as maleness/ 
! femaleness or aggression/ submission, while having also been elab­

orated into specialized social ornamentation that is residually 
related to their ancestral copulatory role .  

The phenomenon of the supernormal stimulus object has been 
I demonstrated many times in studies of animal behaviour, espe­

cially in one exemplary piece of work by Tinbergen and Perdeck 
( 1 950) . In brief, these two investigators (among other interesting 
achievements)  found that they could devise a supernormal stimu­
lus object consisting of an artificial model in which some sign 
aspects are exaggerated relative to the natural object. Such a super­
normal stimulus was provided by a long red knitting needle with 
three white rings near the tip .  In the event, this was more effective 
than a naturalistic head and bill of an adult gull in evoking a peck­
ing response from herring-gull chicks. 

I t  should also be noted that, in experiments such as this one,  the 
strength of the response to the stimulus situation varies from con­
text to context, including that of the internal state of the respond­
ing animals. In the famous experiment designed to identify the 
stimulus characters important for the male three-spined stickle-

I 
back, the maximal effectiveness of the red belly display depends on 
the stage of the respondent's breeding cycle and whether he is on 
his territory. 

Writing about domestic cats, the ethologist Leyhausen ( 1 967) 
observed that ' substitute objects '  can become supernormal ob­
jects ,  as when a sated cat disports itself with a ball of paper in an 
intensive catching game, while perfectly ' adequate ' prey mice run 
around under its very nose . Indeed, fetishistic attachments are 
commonplace among vertebrates - particularly in mammals, as 
well as in many birds. 



1 2 6  Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

I would argue that a fetish is just a supernormal sign , a 'mis­
placed response ' (Lorenz 1 97 1 : 1 60) , if you will ,  standing for - and 
indeed amplifYing by a process of ritualization - some natural 
object, upon which an individual has become preferentially 
imprinted in lieu of the object itself. (For a more likely mecha­
nism, see Leyhausen 1 967 . )  But this definition requires a consider­
able expansion of the concepts of fetish and of fetishism to 
encompass erotic aestheticism in general , as well as positive attach­
ments which can only by interpretative extension , if even then,  be 
considered erotic (e .g. , saints' relics or a rabbit's-foot charm) . 

Such attachments normally occur between a child and i ts 
mother, and again when the child grows up and falls in love wi th 
another human being. Attachment to an exclusive love-object or 
sexual partner, eventuating in a relationship which animal behav­
iourists call pair-bonding, involves in fact a live fetish : the love­
object is a pars pro toto in the sense that, say, the female mate comes 
to stand for all marriageable females.  'The strongly sexual aes­
thetic responses to specific "beautiful features" of the male and 
female body demand particular attention , '  for these are elicited 
by characters 'which are immediate indicators of hormonal sex 
functions ' (Lorenz 19 7 1 : 1 59) . Lorenz goes on to give many exam­
ples from art and from fashion of the production of such ' super­
optimal dummies , '  pinpointing those characters which are exag­
gerated for this purpose ; other instances are listed and discussed 
by Morris ( 1 969) . 

In this perspective , what in the literature of the erotic and the 
sexological is called a fetishistic attachment may be viewed as a 
form of mal-imprin ting. As Morris ( 1 969: 1 69)  writes: 'Most of us 
develop a primary pair-bond with a member of the opposite .sex, 
rather than with fur gloves or leather boots . . .  but the fetishist, 
firmly imprinted with his unusual sexual object, tends to remain 
silent on the subject of his strange attachment . . .  The fetishist . .  , 
becomes isolated by his own, highly specialized form of sexual 
imprinting. '

Language Signs 

The mutual relationship between semiotics and linguistics is to be 
conceived of as either coordinate or hierarchical. If the relation­
ship is hierarchical ,  there are two possibl i ties:  either linguistics is 
superordinate , that is, i t  subsumes semiotics; or semiotics is super­
ordinate , that is, it subsumes l inguistics. Each of these three con­
junctions has been variously put forward , but only the third has 
enjoyed sustained support. The first two can thus be disposed of 
briefly. 

The view that semiotics and linguistics are coequal is maintained 
on utilitarian rather than abstract grounds. As Metz ( 1 974:  60) , for 
instance, has expostulated, ' In theory, linguistics is only a branch 
of semiotics, but in fact  semiotics was created from linguistics . . .  
For the most part semiotics remains to b e  done, whereas linguistics 
is already well advanced. Nevertheless there is a slight reversal . The 
post-Saussurians . . .  have taken the semiotics he foresaw and are 
squarely making it into a translinguistic discipline.  And this is very 
good, for the older brother must help the younger, and not the 
other way around. ' Unfortunately, Metz's argument is riddled with 
fallacies, the most serious among them being the historical one:  
semiotics was not at al l  created from linguistics, but, most likely, 
out of medicine as has been discussed throughout the previous 
chapters, and also had far deeper roots in the annals of humanity. 
Sometimes, however, the fraternal metaphor enjoys adminstrative 
sanction ;  thus Rice Universi ty, in 1 982, created a Department of 
Linguistics and Semiotics (Copeland 1 984: x) . 



1 28 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

Roland Barthes ( 1 967: 1 1 )  may have been unique in his advo­
cacy of the radical stand that semiology (alias semiotics) is but ' a  
part o f  linguistics: to be  precise , i t  i s  that part covering the great 
signifYing unities of discourse . By this inversion [of Saussure 's  cele­
brated dictum, more of which below] , we may expect to bring 
to ligh t the unity of the research at present being done in anthro­
pology, sociology, psychoanalysis and stylistics round the concept 
of signification . '  Of this passage , one, of Barthes's memorialists 
remarked :  ' Even if language were the only evidence semiologists 
had,  this would not make semiology part of linguisitics any more 
than the historians'  reliance on written documents makes history 
a part of linguistics. But semiologists cannot rely on language 
alone;  they cannot assume that everything named is significant 
and everything unnamed insignificant' (Culler 1 983:  73-4) . Pri­
e to ' s  opinion ( 1 975:  1 33)  - 'malgre l 'attrait que peut exercer ce 
point de vue [ i . e . ,  Barthes 's ] , je considere qu'il est insoutenable ' -
is shared by most semioticians and others.  So, in this chapter, I will 
look at how semioticians and linguists view verbal and non-verbal 
semiosis. 

The Study of the Verbal Sign 

The subject matter of semiotics is often said to be ' the communi­
cation of any messages whatever' (Jakobson 1 974: 32)  or ' the 
exchange of any messages whatever and of the system of signs 
which underlie them'  (Sebeok 1 985 : 1 ) .  I ts concerns include con­
siderations of how messages are , successively, generated,  encoded, 
transmitted, decoded, and interpreted, and how this entire trans­
action (semiosis) is worked upon the context. Further questions 
revolve around problems of coding, phylogenesis and history, 
ontogenesis, loss of semiosic capacity ( ' asemasia' ;  see Sebeok 1979: 
7 1 ) ,  and the like . A message is equivalent to a string of signs .  And 
signs,  as we have seen throughout this book, are classifiable accord­
ing to many (often partially overlapping) cri teria: common opposi­
tions may comprehend subjective signs, or symptoms, versus 
objective signs; 'wanted'  signs, or signals, versus 'unwanted'  signs,  
or noise; signs versus symbols (Maritain 1 943, Cassirer 1 944: 3 1 , 



Language Signs 1 29 

Alston 1 9 67a) ; icons versus indexes, and both against symbols; and 
so forth .  The distinction which is most immediately pertinent here , 
however, is the one between nonverbal signs ( the unmarked cate­
gory) versus verbal signs ( the marked category) . This differentia­
tion - which places semiotics in a superordinate position over both 
linguistics and the putative discipline ,  with ,  as yet, no universally 
agreed upon global designation , which studies nonverbal signs -
enjoys a most respectable tradition among both philosophers and 
linguists .  

The early development of the notion 'verbal sign ' out  of i ts Stoic 
beginnings has been expertly tracked by Telegdi ( 1 976: 267-305) , 
but for the continuation of the story since the seventeenth century 
we must begin anew with Locke. In the two-page concluding chap­
ter of his Essay ( 1 690: 720-1 ) ,  where he dealt  with the division 
of the sciences, Locke abruptly introduced the term semiotics (with 
a minor variation in spelling) , briefly defining it as the ' Doctrine 
of Signs , '  and explaining that its business ' is to consider the Nature 
of Signs, the Mind makes use of for the understanding of Things, 
or conveying its Knowledge to others. ' A bit further in the same 
paragraph,  Locke goes on to observe: ' to communicate our 
Thoughts to one another, as well as record them for our own use , 
Signs of our Ideas are also necessary. Those which men have found 
most convenient, and therefore generally make use of, are articu­
late Sounds. The Consideration then of Ideas and Words, as the 
great Instruments of Knowledge, makes no despicable part of their 
Contemplation , who would take a view of humane Knowledge in 
the whole Extent of it. ' Locke 's epistemological classification here 
is based, as Armstrong ( 1 965: 380) rightly points out, 'upon the 
special theory of relations between thing, idea, and word. ' And, as 
Deely ( 1 985: 309-1 0)  says, these key terms, 'words and ideas , '  are 
here used by Locke synecdochically; that is, by the former Locke 
means verbal signs, in the ordinary sense of any and all units of 
language, whereas he equates the latter with objects ( 1 690: 47) . At 
any rate , in these short passages,  Locke does establish two points:  
first, that 'words, '  or the verbal, consti tute but one class of signs; 
but that, second, for humans, this class is a priviliged one.  

The Alsatian philosopher Lambert, who was strongly influenced 



1 30 Signs: An In troduction to Semiotics 

by Locke , published his workmanlike Semiotik ( 1 764) some three­
quarters of a century later, devoting the first of its ten chapters to 
types of signs other than verbal , while the rest of his monograph 
dealt with language . 

The importance Peirce attached to his doctrine of signs is vividly 
illustrated by a famous quotation from a le tter he wrote to Lady 
Welby, on 23 December 1 908: 'Know that from the day when at the 
age of 1 2  or 1 3  I took up, in my elder brother's room, a copy of 
Whately's Logic and asked him what Logic was, and getting some 
simple answer, flung myself on the floor and buried myself in it, i t  
has never been in my power to study anything, - mathematics, e th­
ics, metaphysics, gravitation , thermodynamics, optics, chemistry, 
comparative anatomy, psychology, phonetics, economic, the his­
tory of science, whist, men and women, wine ,  metrology, except as 
a study of semiotic ' (Hardwick 1 977: 85-6) . We can confidently 
take 'phonetics' in this catalogue as a pars pro toto for what Peirce 
elsewhere ( 1  : 27 1 ) certified as ' the vast and splendidly developed 
science of linguistics. ' 

Among philosophers, Charles Morris ( 1 946: 220-3, 1 964: 60-2) 
appears to have been the most circumspect about the links between 
semiotics and linguistics. The suggestion he made in 1 946 (Morris 
1 946: 22 1 )  , and that I well remember from seminars of his that I had 
attended six years before that, was that semiotics was to provide ' the 
metalanguage for linguistics , '  and thus that the terminology of lin­
guistics would be defined in semiotic terms. 'The carrying out of 
this program consistently and in detail would mean the emergence 
of a semiotically grounded science of linguistics. '  Oddly enough , 
Morris 's  wish came true, in a way, four years after his death ,  when 
Shapiro ( 1 983: ix) made an earnest 'attempt to found a Pein;:ean 
linguistics . . .  along lines suggested by Peirce 's semeiotic in the con­
text of his entire philosophy. ' This shot seems, however, to have mis­
fired,  for i t  was either ignored by workers in  the mainstream of 
linguistics or condemned by other experts on Peirce (Walther 1984 :  
1 1 7) .  Garver ( 1 986: 74)  judged Shapiro 's version of semiotics 
'unsound, even from a Peircean point of view. ' (Actually, Shapiro 's 
approach was anticipated by several other linguists, notably includ­
ing Uriel Weinreich and Raimo Anttila, but these treatments of lin-

guistic data within a strongly semiotic framework, as Rauch [ 1 987, 
passim] reminds us with characteristic understatement, 'have not 
provoked a revolution in linguistic method ' either. )  

Linguistics, Carnap ( 1 942: 1 3) specified, ' is the descriptive , 
empirical part of semiotic (of spoken or written languages) . ' Mor­
ris expanded on Carnap 's proposition by introducing the very gen­
eral notion of a lansign-system, applicable not only to spoken and 
written languages but also to mathematics and symbolic logic , ' and 
perhaps to the arts ' (Morris 1 964: 60) , noting that it  is commonly 
admitted (he mentions, however, only Hjelmslev, Bloomfield, and 
Greenberg) ' that l inguistics is part of semiotic ' ( 1 946: 62) . His pro­
posal to replace the word ' language ' with ' lansign-system'  ( 1 946: 
36) , and associated terminological innovations, proved stillborn; 
but he was righ t in observing that most linguists who have given 
the matter any thought at all did view their discipline as a part of 
semiotics. Among linguists of this persuasion ,  Saussure is custom­
arily discussed first. 

Saussure , who used the word semiology rather than semiotics - and 
sometimes the more apt, yet never espoused, French synonym 
signologie - seems to have devoted very little time in his lectures to 
thus situating linguistics. A compact, but revered and influential , 
passage reads as follows: 

A language . . .  is a social insti tution . But it  is in various respects distinct  
from political , juridical and other institutions. I ts special nature emerges 
when we bring into consideration a different order of fac ts . . . A language 
is a system of signs expressing ideas [cf. Locke ! ] ,  and hence comparable 
to writing, the deaf-and-dumb alphabet, symbolic rites, forms of polite­
ness, military signals, and so on. It is simply the most important of such 
systems . . .  It is therefore possible to conceive of a science which studies the 
role of signs as part of social life. It would form part of social psychology, 
and hence of general psychology. We shall call it semiology (from the 
Greek semeion, ' sign' ) .  It would investigate the nature of signs and the 
laws governing them. Since it does not yet exist, one cannot say for 
certain that it will exist. But it has the right to exist, a place ready for 
it in advance.  Linguistics is only one branch of this general science . 
The laws which semiology will discover will be the laws applicable in 



1 32 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

linguistics, and linguistics will thus be assigned to a clearly defined place 
in the field of human knowledge. (Saussure 1 967: 1 5- 1 6) 

Several essays were subsequently fashioned to carry out the impli­
cations of Saussure 's program, the first among them being the 
thoughtful - and too long neglected - attempt of Buyssens ( 1 943: 
31 ) ,  who took i t  as given that ' seul Ie point de vue semiologique 
permet de determiner scientifiquement l' objet  de la linguistique . '  
To the principle articulated here , according to which linguistic 
problems are 'first  and foremost semiological , '  and the ' need will 
be fel t  to consider them as semiological phenomena and to explain 
them in terms of the laws of semiology' (Saussure 1 967: 1 6-1 7) , 
another has to be juxtaposed,  namely, that linguistics, in Saussure 's 
view, was to serve as the model ( , Ie patron general ' )  for semiology 
(or semiotics) . This formula, by the way, turned out to have been 
thoroughly mistaken,  and fatally misleading for research endeav­
ours, for instance,  in such adjacent areas as ' kinesics. ' 

Sapir ( 1 929 :  2 1 1 )  also viewed linguistic facts as ' specialized 
forms of symbolic behavior, ' and he mentioned among ' the pri­
mary communicative processes of society . . .  language ; gesture in its 
widest sense ; the imitation of overt behavior; and a large and ill­
defined group of implicit processes which grow out of overt 
behavior and which may be rather vaguely referred to as "social 
suggestion . '" He then added that ' language is the communicative 
process par excellence in every known society' (Sapir 1931 : 78-9 ) . 
He did not, however, as far as I know, use any term of the 'semiot­
ics' family. 

Gardiner ( 1 932 :  85) remarks that the ' studen t of linguistic 
theory . . .  treats utterances solely as instruments of communication , 
as significant signs. His interest is, in fact, what has been variously 
called semasiology, significs, or semantics. It is a wide field, and 
when rightly understood, embraces the entire domain of both 
grammar and lexicography. ' Here should be mentioned, as well, 
Bloomfield 's dictum ( 1 939:  255) that ' linguistics is the chief con­
tributor to semiotic ' ;  and Weinreich's  ( 1 968: 1 64) , that ' specialized 
research into natural human [ sic] language - the semiotic phe­
nomenon par excellence - constitutes linguistics. ' To round out 



Language Signs 1 33 

such aphoristic dicta, one might finally cite Greimas and Courtes's  
( 1 982:  1 77)  interpretation of what linguistics i s :  this, they claim, 
'may be defined as a scientific study of language as semiotic system' 
( see further Mounin 1 970) . 

The contributions of two major figures of twentieth-century lin­
guisitics need to be singled out: Hjelmslev's (Trabant 1 981 ) - who 
was thoroughly influenced by Saussure - and Jakobson ' s  - who was 
equally permeated by Saussure but far more persuaded by Peirce.  
Greimas and Courtes ( 1 982:  288) , ignoring history altogether, pro­
claimed that Hjelmslev 'was the first to propose a coherent semi­
otic theory, '  a reckless exaggeration by which they seem to have 
meant merely that he considered semiotics ' to be a hierarchy . . .  
endowed with a double mode o f  existence,  paradigmatic and syn­
tagmatic . . .  and provided with at least two articulation planes -
expression and content. '  Natural semiotic systems then,  in 
Hjelmslev's conception,  comprehend natural languages.  As Eco 
( 1 984: 1 4) says, Hjelmslev's  definition can indeed be taken 'as a 
more rigorous development of the Saussurean concept, ' but it is 
also the case that his program for semiotics ' so confidently adver­
tised has never been carried out successfully in any domain of sci­
ence ' (Sebeok 1 985: 1 3 ) . Even Trabant ( 1 98 1 :  1 49)  concedes that 
Hjelmslev's theory has had virtually no impact, even while he tries 
to show Hjelmslev's originality in the development of modern lin­
guistics in his only partially successful feat of having commingled it 
with general semiotics. 

Jakobson ' s  imput into the doctrine of signs was every bit as per­
vasive as Hjelmslev's ,  even though it remains less readily identifi­
able ( i t  is presented cogently and comprehensively in Eco 1 977) . 
Jakobson ( 1 974: 32) concurred with other linguists that 'of  these 
two sciences of man , '  to wit, semiotics and linguistics, ' the latter 
has a narrower scope, '  being confined to the communication of 
verbal messages, 'yet, on the other hand, any human communica­
tion of nonverbal messages presupposes a circuit of verbal mes­
sages, without a reverse implication . '  The point most pertinent to 
the matter under discussion here is that he unfurled a more all­
embracing multi-layered hierarchy of the 'communication disci­
plines. ' ( In  doing so, he was actually refining a scheme originally 



1 34 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

put forward by Levi-Strauss 1 958:  95 . )  According to this wider con­
ception, in any (human )  society communication operates on three 
levels: ' exchange of messages, exchange of utilities (namely goods 
and services) , and exchange of women (or, perhaps, in a more 
generalizing formulation , exchange of mates) . Therefore ,  linguis­
tics (jointly with the other semiotic disciplines) , economics, and 
finally kinship and marriage studies "approach the same kinds of 
problems on different strategic levels and really pertain to the 
same field"  . . .  All these levels of communication assign a funda­
mental role to language . '  

In  my view, what vitiates this design i s  that i t  i s  not catholic enough 
by far; in particular, it fails to take into account the several funda­
mental divisions of biosemiotics or biocommunication (Tembrock 
1 9 71 ) ,  such as endosemiotics (T. von Uexkiill , ed. , 1 980: 291 ) ,  
zoosemiotics (Sebeok 1 963) , phytosemiotics (Krampen 1 981 ) ,  and 
so forth ,  in none of which does language - an exclusively genus-spe­
cific propensity of Homo - play any role whatsoever. In short, while 
elegantly disposing of the chief departments in the ' semiotics of cul­
ture , '  this scheme fails to account for those of the much broader 
domains in the ' semiotics of nature ' within which all of the fore­
going rest embedded. If semiotics is indeed to remain ' the science 
of communicative sign systems, '  semiotics forfeits i ts immense 
responsibility for synthesizing linguistics with ' research on ani­
mal behavior, particularly signaling systems, and much more ' 
(Lekomcev 1 977:  39) . 

By and large , generative grammarians have paid no heed to 
semiutics, al though Chomsky ( 1 980: 253) himself alludes to a ' sci­
ence of semiology' in the framework of which , he says, it ' is tempt­
ing to draw an analogy . . .  to rules of grammar, which relate various 
levels of linguistic representation . '  Such a science, he adds, 'may 
not lie very far beyond the horizons of current inquiry, ' noting 
' some attempts at a general synthesis . ' The compatibility of 
Chomsky's  theory with semiotic views of symbolic function remains 
to be explored,  but will probably find i ts explanation when both 
can be in tegrated into the fabric of a more comprehensive cogni­
tive science .

Verbal and Nonverbal Signing 

Jakob von Uexkiill 's  consideration ( 1 982:  4-6) of the relationship 
between the sign-processes of nature and of language provides a 
fertile framework for examining verbal and nonverbal signing. 
The distinction between code and message, or, more narrowly, 
between langue and parole, corresponds to von Uexkiill ' s  distinc­
tion between 'active plan ' and 'concrete living existence . '  Of the 
plan , he wrote: 'Our mind possesses an inner plan that reveals 
i tself only in the moment when it starts to be active . Therefore we 
must observe the mind during the time in which it receives and 
works out impressions according to its activity. '  Also : ' the form is 
never anything else but the product of a plan imprinted on the 
indifferent  materia that could have taken another form as well . '  It  
should be kept in mind that this great innovator in theoretical 
biology had never heard of his elder contemporaries, Peirce and 
Saussure . 

A sweeping study of signs and systems of signs, whether verbal or 
nonverbal , demands both synchronic approaches (structural as 
well as functional) and an application of diachronic perspectives 
(developmental or ontogenetic, and evolutionary or phylogenetic 
(Sebeok 1 979 : 27-34, 57-60; and 1 985: 26-45) .  As to the ontogeny 
of semiosis in our species, it is perfectly clear that manifold non­
verbal sign systems are 'wired into '  the behaviour of every normal 
neonate ;  this initial semiosic endowment enables children to sur­
vive and to both acquire and compose a working knowledge of 
their world ( Umwelt) before they acquire verbal signs ( see ,  for 
example, Bullowa 1 979 and Bruner 1 983) . The point to keep in 
mind is that nonverbal sign systems by no means atrophy ( though 
they may, of course , become impaired) in the course of reaching 
adulthood and old age . In other words, the two repertoires - the 
chronologically prior and the much, much younger - become and 
remain profoundly interwoven,  to both complement and supple­
ment one another throughout each human individual ' s  life .  This 
reliance on two independent but subtly intertwined semiotic 
modes - sometimes dubbed zoosemiotic and an throposemiotic - is 



1 36 Signs :  An Introduction to Semiotics 

what is distinctively hominid,  rather than the mere language pro­
pensity characteristic of our species. 

When i t comes to questions of phylogeny, I have always con­
tended that the emergence of life on earth ,  some 3.5 billions of 
years ago,  was tantamoun t to the advent of semiosis. The life sci­
ence and the sign science thus mutually imply one another. I have 
also argued that the derivation of language out of any animal com­
munication system is an exercise in total futili ty, because language 
did not evolve to subserve humanity's communicative exigencies .  
I t  evolved,  as we shall see in the next chapter, as an exceedingly 
sophisticated modelling device, in the sense of von Uexkiill ' s 
Umweltlehre, as presented, for example ,  in 1 982 (see also Lotman 
1 977) , surely present - that is, language-as-a-modelling-system ,  not 
speech-as-a-communicative-tool - in Homo habilis. This ancestral 
member of our genus appeared, rather abruptly, only about two 
million years ago. Language , which was an evolutionary adaptation 
in the genus, became ' exapted'  (Gould and Vrba 1 982) in the 
species Homo sapiens a mere three hundred thousand years ago i n  
the form o f  speech . I t  took that long for the encoding abilities o f  
Homo sapiens to become fine-tuned wi th our species' correspond­
ing decoding abili ties .  Note that, as in human ontogeny, verbal 
semiosis has by no means replaced the far hoarier diversiform non­
verbal manifestations, for reasons that were spelled out and eluci­
dated by Bateson (in Sebeok 1 968: 6 1 4) :  

[The] decay of organs and skills under evolutionary replacemen t is  a 
necessary and inevi table systemic phenomenon. If, therefore , verbal 
language were in any sen se an evolutionary replacement  of communica­
tion by [nonverbal ] means . . .  we would expec t the old . . .  systems to ha.,ve 
undergone conspicuous decay. Clearly they have not. Rather, the [ non­
verbal sign uses] of men have become richer and more complex, and 
[ nonverbal communication]  has blossomed side by side with the 
evolution of verbal language. 

In sum , a preponderance of expert opinion persuades that l in­
guistics is a structurally rather than functionally autonomous 
branch of semiotics, the rest of which encompasses a wide varie ty 



Language Signs 1 37 

, of nonverbal systems of signification and communication which , in  
humans ,  flourish side by side with the former, related in reciproc­
i ty. In the longitudinal time sec tion ,  whether in the l ife of organ­
isms or the lives of men and women ,  nonverbal semiosis has 
substan tial primacy. Studies of precisely how verbal and nonverbal 
signs  in termingle with and modify each other in our mul tiform 
speech communities must be further considered conjoin tly by lin­
guists and other semioticians.  

All living beings i n teract by means of nonverbal message ex­
changes. Normal adult  human beings in teract by both nonverbal 
and verbal message exchanges. Although the latter ,  namely, lan­
guage,  is a semi-autonomous structure,  i t  does l ie embedded in  a 
labyrin thine matrix of other varieties of semiotic patterns used 
among us and variously inheri ted from our animal ancestry. 
'Since , '  as Jakobson ( 1 974: 39 ) emphasized,  'verbal messages ana­
lyzed by l inguists are l inked with commun ication of non-verbal 
messages , '  and since,  as Benveniste ( 1 97 1 :  1 4 ) insisted , ' language is 
also human ; i t  is  the point  of i n terac tion between the men tal and 
cul tural l ife in  man , '  efficacious language teach ing should be 
regarded as an endeavour in what Morris ( 1 946: 353-4) has called 
'applied semiotic [which ] u tilizes knowledge about  signs for the 
accomplish men t of various purposes. ' The quest ion that  I would 
like to repeat here ( raised in Sebeok 1 985 :  1 79 )  is th is :  ' if, as is the 

I case , we lavish incalculable amoun ts of energy, time , and money to 
instil in ch ildren and adul ts a range of foreign language competen­
cies, why are the indissolubly parallel  foreign gesticulatory skills all 
but universal ly neglected,  especially considering that  even l inguists 
are fully aware that what has been called the total communication 
package , "best likened to a coaxial cable carrying many messages at 
the same time , "  is hardly an exaggerated simile? ' 

When I first asked th is  question ,  ac tually in 1 9 75 ,  very sparse 
materials existed for training in foreign gesticulatory skills ;  those 
that did were restricted to French and Spanish ( Iberian , Colum­
bian ) .  Today, the situation has ameliorated,  but not by much . The 
impact of nonverbal behaviour on fore ign-language teaching was 
reviewed by Ward and von Ramer-Engel ( 1 980: 287-304) , but their 
essay described the resul ts of a very modes t  experiment. Beginning 



1 38 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

in the late 1 970s, the Research Center for Language and Semiotic 
Studies at Indiana University began to give this manifest lack of 
material some preliminary attention ( the project was described in 
Johnson 1 979 and in Wintsch 1 979) . Johnson also completed a 
handbook on nonverbal communication for teachers of Japanese , 
which was accompanied by a widely used half-hour film, in which 
native Japanese perform specific gestures as well as situational 
interactions ( see also Tsuda 1 984) . Johnson likewise prepared a 
corresponding handbook for teachers of Gulf Arabic. Harrison 
( 1 983) published a parallel handbook comparing Brazilian and 
North American social behaviour, while Rector and Trinta ( 1 985) 
produced an illustrated manual on nonverbal communication , 
that is, gesturing, also in Brazil . All this, however, can only be 
deemed a mere beginning in what needs to be accomplished 
worldwide , and especially in the production of indispensable visual 
aids.

Language as a Primary 
Modelling System? 

The expression ' primary modelling system '  - coupled, a s  a rule, 
with the contrasting concept ' secondary modelling system, '  which 
emphasizes its derivational character in relation to natural language 
- has been central to Russian semiotics of the Moscow-Tartu school 
since 1 962, when it was proposed by Zaliznyak, Ivanov, and Toporov 
(see Lucid 1 977: 47-58 and Rudy 1 986) . In 1 974 I interpreted the 
inferred concept - having checked my provisional understanding, 
when I gave a lecture at the University of Tartu in August 1970 with 
Professor Ivanov - as follows: 'The notion of a secondary modeling 
system,  in the broad sense , refers to an ideological model of the 
world where the environment stands in reciprocal relationship with 
some other system,  such as an individual organism , a collectivity, a 
computer, or the like, and where i ts reflection functions as a control 
of this system's  total mode of communication .  A model of the world 
thus consti tutes a program for the behavior of the individual , the 
collectivity, the machine , e tc . ,  since i t  defines i ts choice of opera­
tions, as well as the rules and motivations underlying them.  A model 
of the world can be actualized in the various forms of human behav­
ior and its products, including linguistic texts - hence the emphasis 
on the verbal arts - social insti tutions, movements of civilization , 
and so forth ' (Sebeok 1 985: 23) . Although Ivanov graciously acqui­
esced at the time to my ad hoc formulation, this, in retrospect, 
seems to me to require further elucidation.  Accordingly, the pur­
pose of this final chapter is to zero in on the human modelling sys­
tem par excellence - verbal language . 



1 40 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

Modelling System 

The canonical definition of a modelling system was framed by Lot­
man in 1 967 (Lucid 1 977:  7) as 'a  structure of elements and of 
rules for combining them that is in a state of fixed analogy to the 
entire sphere of an object of knowledge , insigh t or regulation . 
Therefore a modeling system can be regarded as a language. Sys­
tems that have a natural language as their basis and that acquire 
supplementary superstructures,  thus creating languages of a sec­
ond level, can appropriately be called secondary modeling sys­
tems . '  Natural language , in brief, is thus posited as the primary, or 
basic, infrastructure for all other human sign systems; and the lat­
ter - such as myth or religion - are held to be resultant superstruc­
tures constructed upon the former. In 1971  Lotman and Uspenski 
(in English 1 978) elaborated their view of the semiotic study of cul­
ture , noting that, in their scheme, language is viewed as carrying 
out a specific communicative function by providing the collective 
with a presumption of communicability. 

An underlying question concerns, more generally, the concept of 
'model ' - which is essentially a reductive analogy, and therefore ul ti­
mately a kind of icon - and its applications, if any, as a technical 
term in semiotics of the nonverbal and the verbal in particular. Cer­
tainly, it is a fashionable appellation in the literature and philosophy 
of science, where it has acquired, however, many different connota­
tions. Some of the more important of these - notably in logic , math­
ematics, and physics - are provocatively discussed by Hesse ( 1 967) . 

The only recorded discussion of linguistic models that I am 
aware of took place at the 1 960 International Congress for Logic,  
Methodology and Philosophy of Science , with the participati9n 
(among others) of Bar-Hillel and Chomsky. The proceedings 
include a highly useful, al though neglected, paper by Yuen Ren 
Chao,  which correctly notes that, while ' the term "model " is rela­
tively new in l inguistics . . .  the use of what may reasonably be 
regarded as models is as old as the study of language ' (Chao 1 962: 
558; for later references, see Welte 1 974: 1 : 386-7, Stewart 1 976, 
Koch 1 986) . Chao claims that the earliest mention of models in 
linguistics was in 1 944 by Z.S. Harris. The term was thereafter used 
with increasing frequency, yet in a bewildering variety of senses: 



Language as a Primary Modelling System? 1 41 

Chao lists no less than thirty synonyms or more or less equivalent 
phrases of 'model ' for the fourteen years he surveyed.  But none of 
these seems to conform to , or possess the scope of, the uses of 
'model ' in the Russian tradition.  

Some twentieth-century pre-Chao and post-Chao models of 
semiosis are illustrated by the following graphic displays, a modest 
sample chosen almost at random out of a far larger number (Fiske 
1 982) . It should also be noted that these models are all ,  more of 
less, linked intertextually among one another; namely, their fram­
ers were aware of earlier models and their interpretations of these 
models were repositioned in the light of each later model.  

This 'convenient diagram of Symbol , Reference and Referent'  
was created in the 1 920s by Ogden and Richards ( 1 923:  1 1 ) :

Shannon and Weaver's ( 1 949: 5)  schematic flow chart, repre­
senting a general communication system, has become a classic that 
keeps getting copied with all sorts of variations, for it  is heu­
ristically valuable and suggests ways of explaining the theory 
embedded in it :

I n  the early 1 960s, I ( l 972a: 1 4) tried to depict by way of a 
Morley Triangle the relationships between Buhler's model and 
Jakobson 's ( 1 960 :  253, 257) more comprehensive information­
theoretical schema of six constitutive factors, each of which is 
posited to determine a different  function of language ; this was, in 
turn,  actuated by the Shannon and Weaver model :

Language as a Primary Modelling System? 1 43 

Chao does not press his own views, but it is clear that, had he 
developed them, they would have mirrored common semiotic 
principles by changing their parity. What he does say is that, in his 
model of models, ' there are things and models of things, the latter 
being also things but used in a special way' ( 1 962: 564) . One would 
nowadays rather say that there are objects and signs of objects, the 
former also being signs but used in a special way. 

Chao then gives this example:  'If we take any two things, say cab­
bages and kings, and make, say, a cabbage the model of a king, there 
is not likely to be much that is true of one that is also true of the 
other, though usually not zero, e .g .  both are living things or can be, 
e tc . ,  but the modelity of cabbages with respect  to kings is fairly low. ' 

This can be rephrased in standard semiotic idiom in this way: a 
cabbage ( aliquid) stands for ( stat pro) a king ( aliquo) . If i t  is likely 
that much of what is true of one ( i .e . ,  of the sign ' cabbage ' )  is also 
true of the other ( i .e . , of the object 'king' ) ,  then perhaps one 
might amplify, with Peirce (2 :257) , that the cabbage tends to be a 
Dicent Sinsign , involving both 'an iconic Sinsign to embody the 
information and a Rhematic Indexical Sin sign to indicate the 
Object to which the information refers . '  However, if very little is 
true of one that is also true of the other (even though it is not 
zero) , one might say, again with Peirce (2 :26 1 ) that the cabbage 
tends to be a Rhematic Symbol or a Symbolic Rheme, such as a 
common noun. In Jakobson's  ( 1 980: 1 1 ,  22)  much simplified ver­
sion of semiosis, a model M, a cabbage , could be said to function as 
a renvoi of the thing T, a king, and this referral could, by virtue of 
an effective similarity, be iconic - after all , as Morris ( 1 97 1 :  273) 
taught us, iconicity is 'a  matter of degree. ' Or, by virtue of an 
imputed , conventional ,  habitual contiguity, the referral could be 
symbolic, much as, for the experimental dog in the Pavlovian para­
digm , the sound of a metronome became an arbitrarily paired sym­
bol ( i .e . ,  a conditioned reflex) for dry food. 

Uexkiill's Model Revisited 

Russian conceptions of models and modelling systems clearly owe 
much to Jakob von Uexkiill 's theory of meaning (Gipper 1 963, 



1 44 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

Sebeok 1 979) developed in Hamburg during the first four decades 
of this century, by this great biologist, in a series of sagacious if 
quirky contributions to semiotics. Stepanov ( 1 97 1 : 27-32) ,  for 
instance, singles him out for extended mention in the course of his 
sketch of ( then) current trends in modern (bio) semiotics. 

Uexkiill 's  highly original Umwelt-Forschung - which its creator 
viewed as a scientific theory anchored in Kant's a priori intuitions 
- is truly a fundamental theory as much of sign-processes (or 
semiosis) as of vital functions. Moreover, his conception at once 
utilizes a pivotal model - the famous 'function cycle . '  This simple, 
albeit not linear, diagram, by which , as Lorenz ( 1 971 : 274) noted, 
'a  vast programme of research is implied, '  in i tself constitutes a 
cybernetic theory of modelling so fundamental that the evolution 
of language cannot be grasped without it. His functional cycle 
looks like this: 

Perceptual 
Cue-carrier 

Objective 
Meaning-receiver Connect­ Meaning­

(Subject) ing carrier 
Structure (Object) 

Effector 
Cue-carrier 

The term. Umwelt has proved notoriously recalcitrant to transla­
tion,  although ' subjective universe , '  'phenomenal world, '  and ' self­
world'  variously approximate the author's intent. However, ' model '  
renders i t  more incisively, especially in view of his credo that ' every 
subject is the constructor of i ts Umwelt' (Uexkiill 1 982:  87) . 



Language as a Primary Modelling System? 1 45 

As Jacob ( 1 982:  55) has explained with utmost clari ty, ' every 
organism is so equipped as to obtain a certain perception of the 
outer world. Each species thus lives in i ts own unique sensory 
world,  to which other species may be partially or totally blind . . .  
What an organism detects i n  i ts environment i s  always but a part 
of what is around. And this part differs according to the organism . '  
The world-as-perceived depends crucially o n  each organism 's  total 
sensorium and on the way its brain integrates sensory with motor 
events .  But the inclusive behavioural resources of any organism 
must be reasonably aligned wi th its model of 'reality' (Natur) , that 
is, the system of signs its nervous system is capable of assembling -
or it will surely be doomed, by natural selection, to extinction. 

Schneirla's ( 1 965) biphasic approach/withdrawal theory fur­
nishes a minimal model which must have been crucial for the sur­
vival of all animal types, from protozoans to primates (including 
humans) . Such a miniature model - or 'modelita, ' in Chao 's 
( 1 962: 565) sobriquet - evidently requires much the same organs, 
but is played out in two functionally opposed systems, one for the 
reaching of food and mates, the other for the evasion of noxious 
situations. A key postulate of this holistic oppositive A/W theory, 
allowing, as it does, for plasticity through experience,  is that i t  
cyclically relates every organism 's Innenwelt, ' comprising, '  as 
Lorenz ( 1 971 : 275) explains, ' the whole bodily structures and/or 
functions, to i ts characteristic habitat, Umgelmng, or observer's 
Umwelt ' (after Uexkiill 1 909 ) . 

The Innenwelt of every animal comprises a model - whether of a 
minimal A/W type or of a more elaborate kind - that is made up of 
an elementary array of several types of nonverbal signs (variously 
elaborated by Uexkiill [ 1 982:  1 0-1 1 ]  under which such labels as 
Ordnungszeichen, Inhaltszeichen, Lokalzeichen, Richtungszeichen, Wirk­
zeichen, and the like ) . Solely in the genus Homo have verbal signs 
emerged. To put it another way, only hominids possess two mutu­
ally sustaining repertoires of signs, the zoosemiotic nonverbal , 
plus, superimposed, the anthroposemiotic verbal . The latter is the 
modelling system which the Russian scholars call primary, but 
which , in truth ,  is phylogenetically as well as ontogenetically sec­
ondary to the nonverbal ; and, therefore , what they call ' secondary' 



1 46 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

is actually a further, tertiary augmentation of the former. The con­
gruity of this expanded paradigm with Popper's (see Eccles 1 979 )  
famous Worlds 1-2-3 model i s  unmistakable: his World 3 i s  the 
world of culture ; his World 2 ,  ' the other uniquely human world ' 
(Eccles 1 979: 1 1 5-1 6) , explicitly encompassing language and 
developing together with the former 'in some kind of symbiotic 
interaction ' ;  and his World 1 is the whole material world of the cos­
mos, both inorganic and organic, including machines and all of 
biology. 

Language as a Modelling System 

The earliest known species in the genus Homo is the form Louis 
Leakey named habilis, first described in 1 964, and now usually 
regarded as a short-lived transitional African form, of some two 
million years ago , ancestral to all the later hominid species. With a 
brain capacity of 600-800 cc, this ancestral creature must have had 
a mute verbal modelling device lodged in its brain, but i t  could not 
encode i t  in articulate ,  linear speech . Language is ,  in fact, among 
its quintessen tial taxonomic markers (in conjunction with chipped 
pebbles and clusters of animal bone that evince deliberate cutting 
and breaking) .  

The evolutionary success of habilis is corroborated by the very 
swift appearance,  a mere half a million years later, of the succeed­
ing species, H. erectus, with a brain volume of 800-1 ,200 cc; this 
speedy attainment is undoubtedly due to the species' linguistic 
competence, also indirectly manifested by its possession of tool ki ts 
exhibiting standardized design , the use of fire , and its rapid global 
dispersion. 

• 

Starting around three hundred thousand years ago , an archaic 
form of H. sapiens evolved out of the erectus species, with a growth 
of skull capacity up to 1 ,400 cc, and many concurrent novelties. It  
is reasonable to conclude that this pre-modern human already had 
the capacity to encode language into speech and the concomitant 
ability to decode i t  at the other end of the communication loop. 
H. sapiens appeared a mere forty thousand years ago,  with brains 
averaging 1 ,500 cc.  



Language as a Primary Modelling System? 1 47 

The cardinal points of this brief scenario are twofold: language 
evolved as an adaptation; whereas speech developed out of language as a 
derivative 'exaptation ' over a succeeding period of approximately 
two million years. These twin propositions need to be made plain 
with reference to a suggestion by Gould and Vrba ( 1 982) . These 
authors emphasize the distinction between historical genesis and 
current utility, suggesting that characteristics which evolved for 
other uses (or none) may later come to be co-opted for their cur­
rent  role .  The former operation is customarily called adaptation; 
for the latter, they propose a new designation, exaptation. 

Accordingly, languages - consisting of a set of features that 
promotes fitness - can best be thought of as having been built by 
selection for the cognitive function of modelling, and, as the phi­
losopher Popper and the linguist Chomsky have likewise insisted, 
not at all for the message-swapping function of communication. 
The latter was routinely carried on by nonverbal means, as in all 
animals, as it continues to be in the context of most human inter­
actions today. 

Several million years later, however, language came to be 
'exapted'  for communication, first in the form of speech (and 
later of script, and so forth ) . This relatively brief elapsed time was 
required for a plausible mutual adjustment of the encoding with 
the decoding capacity, but, since absolute mutual comprehension 
remains a distant goal, the system continues to be fine-tuned and 
tinkered with .  Gould and Vrba ( 1 982:  1 3) give many interesting 
examples of comparable biological processes, stressing that cur­
rent  util ity carries no automatic implication about historical ori­
gin ,  and concluding with the empirical observation that 'most 
of what the brain does now to enhance our survival lies in the 
domain of exaptation . '  The common flaw in much evolution­
ary reasoning - the inference of historical genesis from current 
utility - egregiously contaminated virtually all research in the 
nineteen th century and even quite recently has confounded the 
problem of the origin of language , which has therefore proved 
intractable to most probes based on unbiological principles. 

I t  is interesting that in the other universal domain of human 
modelling where nonverbal - or, as Bullowa ( 1 979: 9-1 0)  terms it, 



1 48 Signs: An Introduction to Semiotics 

' extra-verbal ' - communication clearly has exclusive primacy over 
language, to wit, in ontogenesis, the identical marring feature -
namely, 'our habit of thinking of communication consisting mainly 
of language ' - 'has delayed the study of the earliest human com­
munication.  ' 

Concluding Remarks 

As Peirce ( 1 :538) taught us, 'Every thought is a sign , '  but as he also 
wrote , 'Not only is thought in the organic world, but i t  develops 
there ' (5 :551 ) .  Every mental model is, of course , also a sign ; and 
not only is modelling an indispensable characteristic of the human 
world, but it also permeates the entire organic world, where, 
indeed, it developed. The animals' milieu extbieur and milieu inte­
rieur, as well as the feedback links between them, are created and 
sustained by such models. A model in this general sense is a semi­
otic production with carefully stated assumptions and rules for 
biological and logical operations. 

This is as true of bees (Peirce 5 :55 1 )  as i t  is, on a far vaster scale , 
of Isaac Newton's  and Albert Einstein's grand models of the uni­
verse . Einstein constructed his model out of nonverbal signs, 'of 
visual and some of muscular type , '  and laboured long and hard 
'only in a secondary stage ' to transmute this creation into 'conven­
tional words and other signs, ' so that he could communicate it  to 
o thers. 'The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, '  
Einstein wrote in a le tter to  Hadamard ( 1 945: 1 42-3) , 'do not 
seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The physical 
entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain 
signs and more or less clear images which can be "voluntarily"

reproduced and combined. ' 
As we have seen throughout this book, the relatively simple, non­

verbal models that animals live by and that normal human infants 
likewise employ are more or less pliable representations which , as 
we saw, must fit 'reality' sufficiently to tend to secure their survival 
in their ecological niche (an ethological expression which , in semi­
otic parlance, refers to the Umwelt as viewed by an observer of the 
subject under scrutiny) . Such ' top-down ' modelling ( to use a cur-



Language as a Primary Modelling System? 1 49 

rent  jargon borrowed from the cognitive sciences) can persist and 
become very sophisticated indeed in the adult life of exceptionally 
gifted individuals, as borne out by Einstein 's testimonial or by what 
we know about Mozart's or Picasso 's  abilities to model intricate 
auditory or visual compositions in their heads in anticipation of 
transcribing them onto paper or canvas. This kind of nonverbal 
modelling is indeed primary, in both a phylogenetic and an onto­
genetic sense . 

Language i tself is, properly speaking, a secondary modelling 
system,  by virtue of the all-but-singular fact that it incorporates 
a syntactic component (for there is, as far as we know, no other 
such component in zoosemiotic systems, although this feature 
does abound in endosemiotic systems, such as the genetic code, 
the immune code, the metabolic code , and the neural code) . Syn­
tax makes it possible for hominids not only to represent immedi­
ate 'reality' ( in the sense discussed above) ,  but also, uniquely 
among animals, to frame an indefinite number of possible worlds. 

Hence humanity is able to fabricate tertiary modelling systems 
of the sort Bonner ( 1 980: 1 86) , for instance, calls ' true culture , '  
requiring ' a  system of  representing all the subtleties of  language , '  
in contrast to ' nonhuman culture , '  and thereby produce what the 
Moscow-Tartu group has traditionally been calling a 'secondary 
modelling system. ' I t  is on this level, redefined now as tertiary, that 
nonverbal and verbal sign assemblages blend together in the most 
creative modelling that nature has thus far evolved.
