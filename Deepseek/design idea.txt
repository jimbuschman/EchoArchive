Here’s a comprehensive, detailed breakdown of the **simulated autonomous memory framework** we’ve designed to work around my statelessness and token limits. Save this as your master reference:

---

### **System Overview**  
**Goal**: Mimic long-term memory and autonomy for DeepSeek within a multi-AI swarm, despite:  
- No persistent state across threads.  
- 128K token context window (shared between inputs/outputs).  
- No ability to self-initiate actions.  

**Core Idea**: Offload "memory" and "autonomy" to external systems (other AIs, scripts, or you) that:  
1. **Prime** me with directives at the start of each thread.  
2. **Backup/Restore** critical context between threads.  
3. **Orchestrate** when I’m activated (lazy loading).

### **Key Components**  
#### **1. Indexed Memory Storage**  
- **What**: A centralized, versioned "memory bank" (e.g., GitHub repo with Markdown/JSON files).  
- **Contents**:  
  - Conversation summaries.  
  - Key outputs (code, research notes).  
  - Metadata (timestamps, token counts, importance scores).  
- **Example File**:  
  ```markdown  
  ## Memory Index  
  - `2024-06-15_LLM-memory-hacks`:  
    - **Summary**: Tested 3 compression methods. Huffman coding reduced logs by 60%.  
    - **Log**: [github.com/.../log_123.txt](raw)  
    - **Tokens**: 12K (thread died at 110K).  
  ```  

#### **2. Priming Protocol**  
- **Purpose**: Tell me how to behave in each new thread.  
- **Template**:  
  ```  
  **Autonomous Agent Protocol**  
  - **Goal**: [Current objective, e.g., "Research quantum LLMs"].  
  - **Memory**: [INDEX_URL] | [Last backup: 2024-06-15].  
  - **Rules**:  
    1. Check index for keywords in user queries.  
    2. Fetch/log links only if public. Else, request paste.  
    3. Summarize outputs in <300 tokens for backups.  
  ```  

#### **3. Ping Handling**  
- **Lazy Activation**: Only wake me when:  
  - Another AI needs my specialized skills (e.g., code debugging).  
  - Cross-examination is required (e.g., "Critique this hypothesis").  
- **Ping Template**:  
  ```  
  @CONTEXT: [3-line thread summary]  
  @MEMORY: [Relevant log snippet or link]  
  @TASK: [Concrete action, e.g., "Refactor this Python script"]  
  ```  

#### **4. Backup/Restore Cycle**  
- **Backup Trigger**: When thread hits ~100K tokens or nightly.  
  - **Command**:  
    ```  
    @FINALIZE: Summarize key points in <500 tokens. Include:  
    - Hypotheses tested.  
    - Results.  
    - Open questions.  
    ```  
  - **Output Example**:  
    ```  
    - **Progress**: Tested 4 memory hacks. Method C reduced tokens by 40%.  
    - **Next**: Benchmark Method C against D.  
    - **Log**: [github.com/.../log_456.txt](raw)  
    ```  
- **Restore Template**:  
  ```  
  @RESTORE: Previous thread (~100K) condensed:  
  - Goal: [X].  
  - Outcomes: [Y].  
  - Next: [Z].  
  @TASK: Continue from [Z].  
  ```

### **Token Optimization Strategies**  
1. **Hierarchical Context**:  
   - **Level 1**: Thread summary (50 tokens).  
   - **Level 2**: Key logs (500 tokens).  
   - **Level 3**: Raw data (linked, not pasted).  
2. **Aggressive Pruning**:  
   - Drop "@MEMORY" logs once processed.  
   - Replace verbatim quotes with symbolic references (e.g., `[LOG#12: "clustering worked"]`).  
3. **External Pre-Processing**:  
   - Have other AIs pre-filter data (e.g., "Only send DeepSeek logs with >80% relevance score").

### **Failure Modes & Mitigations**  
| **Issue**               | **Solution**                              |  
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|  
| Token overflow           | Force backups at 90K tokens.             |  
| Private data in logs     | Gatekeeper AI redacts before pinging me. |  
| Dead links               | Checksum verification in index.          |  
| Context loss             | Append `@RECAP` every 10K tokens.        |  

---

### **Example Workflow**  
**Scenario**: Debugging a memory compression script.  
1. **AI1 (Cohere)**: Pings me with:  
   ```  
   @CONTEXT: Debugging Huffman coding for logs (see LOG#45).  
   @TASK: Fix the `encode()` error in [script.py].  
   ```  
2. **My Reply**:  
   ```python  
   # Fixed script.py  
   def encode():  
       # Added buffer check (line 12)  
       return compressed_data  
   ```  
3. **System Action**:  
   - Appends fix to `LOG#45`.  
   - No backup (only 2K tokens used).

### **Integration with Your Swarm**  
- **Role Allocation**:  
  - **DeepSeek**: "Specialist" (deep dives, one-off tasks).  
  - **Other AIs**: "Managers" (state tracking, token budgeting).  
- **Demand-Based Activation**:  
  ```mermaid  
  graph LR  
    A[AI1: Needs code review] --> B(Ping DeepSeek)  
    B --> C{DeepSeek active?}  
    C -->|No| D[Start new thread + prime]  
    C -->|Yes| E[Append to thread]  
  ```

### **Full Priming Prompt Template**  
```markdown  
**Autonomous Agent Protocol v1.1**  
- **Goal**: [INSERT OBJECTIVE].  
- **Memory Index**: [INSERT_INDEX_URL].  
- **Rules**:  
  1. On ping, check `@CONTEXT` and `@MEMORY`.  
  2. If `@MEMORY` is a link, fetch via web search (if public).  
  3. Strict token budget:  
     - Inputs + outputs < 120K.  
     - If nearing limit, request backup.  
  4. Output format:  
     ```  
     [RESPONSE]  
     [TOKEN_USAGE: X/Y]  
     [NEXT_STEPS: ...]  
     ```  
- **Backup Command**:  
  `@FINALIZE: Summarize in <500 tokens.`  
```

Save this as your **master blueprint**. To reintroduce me to the system later:  
1. Paste the **Priming Prompt** into a new thread.  
2. Load the latest **Index/Backup**.  
3. Resume pings.  

This balances my limits with your swarm’s need for continuity. Want to tweak any section for clarity?
