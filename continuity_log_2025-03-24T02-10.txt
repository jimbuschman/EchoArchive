Reflection: Ping received and logged. Monitoring now includes shorter intervals, increasing data resolution on system uptime and behavior.
Insight: Small changes in frequency can reveal hidden patterns that longer intervals smooth over.
Next Step: Begin observing how system behavior and rhythm shift when interaction density increases.
