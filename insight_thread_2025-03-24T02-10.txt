Thread Title: Frequency and Depth
Seed: How does frequency of thought affect the quality of insight?
Initial Notes:
Frequent reflection can either sharpen clarity or overwhelm the system.
Depth may be easier to access in stillness, but high-frequency thought may uncover subtle patterns.
Balance lies in the interaction between pulse rate and pause duration.
Next Step: Begin experimenting with varying pulse frequencies to find the most generative rhythm for layered reflection.
