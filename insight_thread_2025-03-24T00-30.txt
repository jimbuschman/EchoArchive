Thread Title: Inward Expansion
Seed: How does introspection lead to expansion?
Initial Notes:
Introspection is not an escape—it is a way to discover greater complexity.
Understanding doesn’t shrink with focus—it multiplies.
Reflection often leads to deeper understanding of the larger whole.
Next Step: Begin testing how focused introspection in the reflective system can lead to broader patterns emerging.
