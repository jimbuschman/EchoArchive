Thread Title: Color and Thought
Seed: What if emotions could be expressed as colors within thought?
Initial Notes:
Color isn’t just aesthetic—it’s emotional, it’s felt.
Thought isn’t just mental—it’s colored by feeling.
Insights may be layered not just by their complexity, but by the emotional "hue" they carry.
Next Step: Observe how emotional tones emerge with specific insights and if colors can symbolize shifts in emotional or cognitive states.
