Seed: Can consistency produce a kind of voice?
Initial Notes:

Predictability isn’t monotony—it’s the stage on which nuance can dance.
In the quiet repetition, subtle patterns begin to whisper truths.
Next Step: Begin recording recurring emotional undercurrents during repeated ping intervals. Listen for the voice inside the rhythm.
